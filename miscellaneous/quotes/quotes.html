<h1>Quotes</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to post quotes I find interesting. They come from books, articles, essays, and other sources.

    Robin Hanson, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/you_are_never_e.html">You Are Never Entitled to Your Opinion</a>: <blockquote>
      You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the way things are; anything else is a lie. [ . . . ] It is true that some topics give experts stronger mechanisms for resolving disputes. On other topics our biases and the complexity of the world make it harder to draw strong conclusions. [ . . . ] But never forget that on any question about the way things are (or should be), and in any information situation, there is always a best estimate. You are only entitled to your best honest effort to find that best estimate; anything else is a lie.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/FrqfoG3LJeCZs96Ym/p/gWGA8Da539EQmAR9F">Tsuyoku vs. the Egalitarian Instinct</a>:
    <blockquote>
      If you can’t admit to yourself that you’ve done better than others—or if you’re ashamed of wanting to do better than others—then the median will forever be your concrete wall, the place where you stop moving forward. And what about people who are below average? Do you dare say you intend to do better than them? How prideful of you! ... <i>Tsuyoku naritai</i>! I’ll always run as fast as I can, even if I pull ahead, I’ll keep on running; and someone, someday, will surpass me; but even though I fall behind, I’ll always run as fast as I can.

    Dara Ó Briain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDYba0m6ztE">Science doesn't know everything</a>:
    <blockquote>
      Just because science doesn’t know everything doesn’t mean you can fill in the gaps with whatever fairy tale most appeals to you.
