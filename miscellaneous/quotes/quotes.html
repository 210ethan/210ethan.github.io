<h1>Quotes</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to post quotes I find interesting. They come from books, articles, essays, and other sources.

    burkey, <a href="http://stationfiveonefive.com/wp/blog/thenextstep/">the next step</a> (quote is entire piece, but every sentence is gold):
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        training is about stress. about the artful application of force. we say art because there are too many factors – there can be no formula… this is like talking about love. the more specific you get the further you are from being useful. we can say “find the problem, fix the problem” – when we start to go past that, we start to hedge our bets a lot… we say “usually” or “it depends” – we answer questions with more questions, we push and pull – we try and get to the next step. to find the weak link, to address the thing that is holding us back. it can be a small muscle. a movement pattern. a timing issue. one of the many forms of psychological weakness… each problem has number of solutions, each with a cost and with side effects – the “right answer” is , at best, right for that person at that time in their struggle. this is where paths diverge, where selling things and truly helping seem to be mutually exclusive, where a discussion on working out turns into a self help seminar...
      </p>
      <p>
        it comes down to a decision. how far do you want to take this? how far are you willing to take this? i am impressed by physical feats insofar as they are the reflection of this willingness. of the hard work and attention to detail. to stare into that mirror, to seek out critical feedback, to realize that the only way to improve is to explore your weaknesses – to dig into the most uncomfortable places, to poke and prod that the things we hate and the things we are afraid of. to realize that we train to maximize our potential. we work to express the very best of ourselves, to hone the edge, to grind away everything that does not make us better. we seek stress. we seek dissenting opinions and challenging moments. we do this to get better. training is a discussion, a conversation – pressure and adaptation. it is a cycle of problems and solutions and side effects and new problems. cause and effect are often intertwined, we can solve the problem – we just need to act. feedback loops. two way streets. they are all threads, a web… tug on one long enough and you will touch the whole, but only if you are willing to be wrong, only if you are willing to be uncomfortable, only if you are willing to let go of your favorite thing and examine the one that actually has a chance helping. it is a curious blend of focus, dedication, and ADHD. of knowing when to pursue, to persevere, and when to step away. this is when it helps to have a coach. a sounding board. anyone really, as long as they care enough to not care about your feelings. to not nod their head and tell you you are doing good but to ask questions, to pick and prod and demand that you make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        we are often too close to our own problems, we warp them with our perception. emotion clouds judgment. the simple question you should always ask when training is “why didn’t  i do better?” – “what stopped me from achieving X?” – “what did that training session accomplish?” –  “how have i been changed?” and after all that, you must ask yourself how full of shit those answers are. questions lead to questions because the goal here is to change. to become. here is the rub – no  one can feel what you feel, therefore no one is as qualified in dictating your training as yourself. in the same breath i will assert that, when it comes to your own progress, you are probably the most biased and untrustworthy source of information available. i feel that the problem often lies in the framing. we don’t know how to think about solving our own problems, too often we look at other peoples process – the prescriptions one specific individual used to get themselves from point A to point B. we are not that person. we are not in that place. we have to learn how to progress. to assess ourselves and make appropriate changes. we have to listen, to learn and to filter. to understand our strengths and weaknesses. to understand what makes us who we are and what is holding us back. only when we understand (or at least can start to comprehend) how our own lens warps the facts can we start to make use of others. to talk to people who are smarter than us. watch people who are better than us. most of us dont have to worry about being innovative because there is already someone out there solving our problem if we would just listen. if we are able to filter out our own distortion and make use of the information. remember to strive. to search the next step. watch video of your movements. talk to friends. talk to enemies. find out where you are and where you want to go. spot the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        figure out why you are doing what you are doing. our choices, our actions move us either closer to our goal or further away. Kate Moss said that “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – Conan had his own feelings on “what is best in life”  –  sort yourself out. find out where you’re at, what you expect, and what you are willing to pay. balance that equation. in short –  start the arduous process of unfucking your head. basically, you have to learn how (and why) to change. it is just as simple and just as complicated as that. the more general the audience, the more likely any specific advice would be wrong. trying to be generally helpful can only help so much – trying to figure out an overarching explanation seems to be falling into the same trap. the important thing is to ask questions. to find peers, serious, passionate people to talk to. to learn from. don’t forget the lessons you bled to learn, but don’t forget that you are not necessarily that person anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        do not mistake the container for the contents, or the symbol for the source.
      </p>
      <p>
        if the goal is to change, what you want to do and what you want to be will, at times, be mutually exclusive. deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        every tool has a time, a place, a purpose, and a price. armor that saves your life in battle will guarantee you drown in the ocean. choose wisely. change when appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        your toolkit alters your perception. we see what we expect to see and we see what we know how to fix. be aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        make progress. a car will get you to the beach, but it will keep you from experiencing the ocean. necessary does not mean permanent. learn, grow, and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        dont be lazy. dont be stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        ask questions, lots of questions – but not at the expense of actually doing something.

      at work, we naturally resent the people who get paid more and work less than we do. We almost never notice the people who are paid less and work more than we do.

    Ran Prieur, <a href="http://ranprieur.com/essays/dropout.html">How to Drop Out</a>:
    <blockquote>
      The main thing I was doing during those years was de-institutionalizing myself, learning to navigate the hours of the day and the thoughts in my head with no teacher or boss telling me what to do. I had to learn to relax without getting lethargic, to never put off washing the dishes, to balance the needs of the present and the future, to have spontaneous fun but avoid addiction, to be intuitive, to notice other people, to make big and small decisions. I went through mild depression and severe fatigue and embarrassing obsessions and strange diets and simplistic new age thinking. It's a long and ugly road, and most of us have to walk it, or something like it, to begin to be free.

  Mark Twight, <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/supertrainer-man-of-steel-trainer-mark-twight.html">Supertrainer: Man Of Steel Trainer Mark Twight</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Somebody asked the other day, "Hey, can an ordinary guy on the street become the Man of Steel with your workout?" And I say no, because there's not a universal physical recipe. If it took 20 years to achieve your current condition, then maybe, if you dedicate all your extra time outside of work and family responsibilities, you could change your current physical condition in a meaningful way with 3 months of constant attention and hard effort. But to change the habits that you developed over those 20 years, and that caused the current condition that you're in? That's going to take years to overwrite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until those habits become automatic—until you're confronted by the doughnut tray at the office and you don't even notice that it exists anymore, and you don't have to go through this process of "Do I get the doughnut? Don't I get the doughnut?"—then you have to pay attention. There are 168 hours in a week. One hour three times per week in the gym is no counterbalance to all of the other behavior in those other 165 hours.

    Mark Twight, <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/recipe">Recipe</a> (select quotes, but the entire essay (5 min) should be read to fully understand):
    <blockquote>
      Recognize the need for change. Revolt against old behavior and habits. Resolve to be consistent and persistent. Define Point B: what you want to achieve, clearly. Define Point A: an honest, unsentimental account of your present state. Decide on a deadline, and give yourself a penalty for missing it. Be realistic. Design the training program: seek guidance.

    <blockquote>
      "When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you" -- Winston S. Churchill. What do you see in this picture? I see some of the most dedicated and badass men on the planet. I see some damn cool moustaches. I see years of dedication. I see amazing skills, knowledge and experience. I see some taken too soon. But most importantly I see unity. I see a team bound together for a common worthwhile objective, albeit uncommon in their valor and collective capability. They are not all the same - their political views differ, their ethnic backgrounds are varied, and in actuality, as is always the case in alpha personality environments, they probably don't even all like each other. But that doesn't mean squat overall. They are professional warriors. They put that [expletive] aside for the common good, they all wear the same uniform and place the same flag upon their sleeve and many on their chest. For they recognize divided they may fall, together they will not. Perhaps some people should remember the power of unity and remember Churchill's words that when there is no division within, external adversaries cannot hurt you.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/L32LHWzy9FzSDazEg">Motivated Stopping and Motivated Continuation</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gilovich’s distinction between motivated skepticism and motivated credulity highlights how conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest that an analogous bias in psychologically realistic search is motivated stopping and motivated continuation: when we have a hidden motive for choosing the “best” current option, we have a hidden motive to stop, and choose, and reject consideration of any more options. When we have a hidden motive to reject the current best option, we have a hidden motive to suspend judgment pending additional evidence, to generate more options—to find something, anything, to do instead of coming to a conclusion.

      It was a lovely starlight night—they had just reached the top of the hill of Villejuif, the platform from whence Paris, like some dar sea, is seen to agitate its millions of lights, resembling phosphoric waves,—waves indeed, more noisy, more passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of the tempestuous ocean,—waves which never lie calm, like those of the vast sea,—waves ever destructive, ever foaming, and ever restless.

    <blockquote>
      To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that everyone sees themselves as behaving normally...Most people see themselves as perfectly normal, from the inside. Even people you hate, people who do terrible things, are not exceptional mutants. No mutations are required, alas. When you understand this, you are ready to stop being surprised by human events.

    From the essay <a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight"><i>Twitching with Twight</i></a> (included in <i>Kiss or Kill</i>):
    <blockquote>
      Live the lifestyle instead of paying lip service to the lifestyle. Live with commitment. With emotional content. Live whatever life you choose honestly. Give up this renaissance man, dilettante [expletive] of doing a lot of different things (and none of them very well by real standards). Get to the guts of one thing; accept, without reservation or rationalization, the responsibility of making a choice. When you live honestly, you can not separate your mind from your body, or your thoughts from your actions.

      The fit are healthy and strong; and many, as a consequence, save themselves decorously on the battle-field and escape all the dangers of war; many help friends and do good to their country and for this cause earn gratitude; get great glory and gain very high honours, and for this cause live henceforth a pleasanter and better life, and leave to their children better means of winning a livelihood.

        <blockquote>
          Each man lives for himself, uses his freedom to achieve his personal goals, and feels with his whole being that right now he can or cannot do such-and-such an actin; but as soon as he does it, this action, committed at a certain moment in time, becomes irreversible and makes itself the property of history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.

          There are two sides to each man's life: his personal life, which is the more free the more abstract its interets, and his elemental, swarmlike life, where the man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him.

          Man lives consciously for himself, but serves as an unconscious instrument for the achievement of historical, universally human goals. An action once committed is irrevocable, and its effect, coinciding in time with millions of actions of other people, acquires historical significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the greater the number of people he is connected with, the more power he has over other people, the more obvious is the predestination and inevitability of his every action.

          "The hearts of kings are in the hands of God."

          Kings are the slaves of history.

          History, that is, the unconscious, swarmlike life of mankind, uses every moment of a king's life as an instrument for its purposes. (Page 605)

    <blockquote>
      You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the way things are; anything else is a lie. [ . . . ] It is true that some topics give experts stronger mechanisms for resolving disputes. On other topics our biases and the complexity of the world make it harder to draw strong conclusions. [ . . . ] But never forget that on any question about the way things are (or should be), and in any information situation, there is always a best estimate. You are only entitled to your best honest effort to find that best estimate; anything else is a lie.
