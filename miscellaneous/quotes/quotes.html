  <blockquote>
    "When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you" -- Winston S. Churchill. What do you see in this picture? I see some of the most dedicated and badass men on the planet. I see some damn cool moustaches. I see years of dedication. I see amazing skills, knowledge and experience. I see some taken too soon. But most importantly I see unity. I see a team bound together for a common worthwhile objective, albeit uncommon in their valor and collective capability. They are not all the same - their political views differ, their ethnic backgrounds are varied, and in actuality, as is always the case in alpha personality environments, they probably don't even all like each other. But that doesn't mean squat overall. They are professional warriors. They put that shit aside for the common good, they all wear the same uniform and place the same flag upon their sleeve and many on their chest. For they recognize divided they may fall, together they will not. Perhaps some people should remember the power of unity and remember Churchill's words that when there is no division within, external adversaries cannot hurt you.

      Using a slow cooker isn't as much of a short cut when the recipe calls for sixteen ingredients you don't have.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/L32LHWzy9FzSDazEg">Motivated Stopping and Motivated Continuation</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gilovich’s distinction between motivated skepticism and motivated credulity highlights how conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest that an analogous bias in psychologically realistic search is motivated stopping and motivated continuation: when we have a hidden motive for choosing the “best” current option, we have a hidden motive to stop, and choose, and reject consideration of any more options. When we have a hidden motive to reject the current best option, we have a hidden motive to suspend judgment pending additional evidence, to generate more options—to find something, anything, to do instead of coming to a conclusion.

    Alexandre Dumas, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/477380.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Zbv66FQRhq&rank=1"><i>Count of Monte Cristo</i></a>, page 1411:
    <blockquote>
      It was a lovely starlight night—they had just reached the top of the hill of Villejuif, the platform from whence Paris, like some dar sea, is seen to agitate its millions of lights, resembling phosphoric waves,—waves indeed, more noisy, more passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of the tempestuous ocean,—waves which never lie calm, like those of the vast sea,—waves ever destructive, ever foaming, and ever restless.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3ELrPerFTSo75WnrH/p/DB6wbyrMugYMK5o6a">Correspondence Bias</a>:
    <blockquote>
      To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that everyone sees themselves as behaving normally...Most people see themselves as perfectly normal, from the inside. Even people you hate, people who do terrible things, are not exceptional mutants. No mutations are required, alas. When you understand this, you are ready to stop being surprised by human events.

    <blockquote>
      It doesn't have to be fun to be fun.
    </blockquote>
    From the essay <a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight"><i>Twitching with Twight</i></a> (included in <i>Kiss or Kill</i>):
    <blockquote>
      Live the lifestyle instead of paying lip service to the lifestyle. Live with commitment. With emotional content. Live whatever life you choose honestly. Give up this renaissance man, dilettante bullshit of doing a lot of different things (and none of them very well by real standards). Get to the guts of one thing; accept, without reservation or rationalization, the responsibility of making a choice. When you live honestly, you can not separate your mind from your body, or your thoughts from your actions.

    Socrates, <a href="http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Xen.%20Mem.%203.12">Xenophon, <i>Memorabilia</i></a>:
    <blockquote>
      The fit are healthy and strong; and many, as a consequence, save themselves decorously on the battle-field and escape all the dangers of war; many help friends and do good to their country and for this cause earn gratitude; get great glory and gain very high honours, and for this cause live henceforth a pleasanter and better life, and leave to their children better means of winning a livelihood.

    Leo Tolstoy, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/290979.War_and_Peace"><i>War and Peace</i></a> (Pevear and Volokhonsky translation, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3470054624">review</a>):
    <ul>

        <blockquote>
          Each man lives for himself, uses his freedom to achieve his personal goals, and feels with his whole being that right now he can or cannot do such-and-such an actin; but as soon as he does it, this action, committed at a certain moment in time, becomes irreversible and makes itself the property of history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.

          There are two sides to each man's life: his personal life, which is the more free the more abstract its interets, and his elemental, swarmlike life, where the man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him.

          Man lives consciously for himself, but serves as an unconscious instrument for the achievement of historical, universally human goals. An action once committed is irrevocable, and its effect, coinciding in time with millions of actions of other people, acquires historical significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the greater the number of people he is connected with, the more power he has over other people, the more obvious is the predestination and inevitability of his every action.

          "The hearts of kings are in the hands of God."

          Kings are the slaves of history.

          History, that is, the unconscious, swarmlike life of mankind, uses every moment of a king's life as an instrument for its purposes. (Page 605)

      Sometimes a perfect storm of fundamental errors, bad luck, and shitty incentives come together to ruin a person’s life, and there is no fix. That’s horrible, and tragic, but it’s probably just reality.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/FrqfoG3LJeCZs96Ym/p/gWGA8Da539EQmAR9F">Tsuyoku vs. the Egalitarian Instinct</a>:
    <blockquote>
      If you can’t admit to yourself that you’ve done better than others—or if you’re ashamed of wanting to do better than others—then the median will forever be your concrete wall, the place where you stop moving forward. And what about people who are below average? Do you dare say you intend to do better than them? How prideful of you! ... <i>Tsuyoku naritai</i>! I’ll always run as fast as I can, even if I pull ahead, I’ll keep on running; and someone, someday, will surpass me; but even though I fall behind, I’ll always run as fast as I can.

    Robin Hanson, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/you_are_never_e.html">You Are Never Entitled to Your Opinion</a>:
    <blockquote>
      You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the way things are; anything else is a lie. [ . . . ] It is true that some topics give experts stronger mechanisms for resolving disputes. On other topics our biases and the complexity of the world make it harder to draw strong conclusions. [ . . . ] But never forget that on any question about the way things are (or should be), and in any information situation, there is always a best estimate. You are only entitled to your best honest effort to find that best estimate; anything else is a lie.
