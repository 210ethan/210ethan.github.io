<h1 id="life_improvements">Life Improvements</h1>

<p>
  Below are a list of items and behaviors/actions (with descriptions and explanations) that have noticeably improved my life or have been said to improve quality of life. Some are complete, while other are awaiting for an appropriate amount of time to pass before giving feedback. Those awaiting feedback are marked with the tentative date I will provide feedback.
</p>

<p>
  Both items and behaviors have a number in the title indicating the benefit on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is negligible and 10 is my life is incredibly better with it, I am much happier because of it, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Please <a href="../../about/about_me/about_me.html#contact">contact me</a> if you have a life improvement suggestion or experience with any of these. I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences.
</p>

<h2 id="items">Items</h2>

<h3 id="items_philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p>
  My lifestyle is quite frugal: I only go out to eat on rare occasions with friends; I spend money on clothes maybe once a year, and even then it is normally second-hand; I don't own any flashy jewelry or extravagant sneakers.
</p>

<p>
  When I want to purchase something, the yes/no decision and amount I'm willing to spend (price doesn't always correlate with quality) depends on the answer to a few questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How long will I be using this? If I'll be using the item for many years, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon. This is known as buying for life, which has its own subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/">r/BuyItForLife</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    How often will I be using this? If I'll be using the item every day, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Does this bring any benefit to my life? Why should I purchase something that brings no benefit to my life, lasting or fleeting?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do others say about this? The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68143.The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">wisdom of crowds</a> is generally reliable, especially on communities dedicated to the item's subject, i.e., mattresses or footwear. Those crowds, which likely include experts, are extremely knowledgable on the subject and will provide trustworthy suggestions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will it pay for itself? I view this by dividing the cost by the number of hours spent using this or, in applicable cases, the breakeven point of renting vs. buying (buying a suit for $1000 is worth it if you need to wear it on 6 occasions and renting costs $200/occasion). If the answer to the first two questions are yes, then this question's answer is likely yes.
  </li>
</ol>

</figcaption>


<p>
  Example items that satisfy all or most questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mattress: I'll be using a mattress almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through high-quality sleep; many recommend high-quality mattresses; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Footwear: I'll be wearing shoes almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through comfortable walking and standing; many recommend high-quality footwear; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vehicle: I'll be driving a car almost every day for the next 50 years; it brings great benefit through quick, easy, and comfortable transportation; seeing people have to pay exorbitant maintenance fees on their European cars is enough to turn me on to Japanese-branded vehicles; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clothing: I'll be wearing clothes every day for the rest of my life; it brings benefit through feeling comfortable and looking good; others agree that low-quality clothing easily falls apart—spending extra money on high-quality clothing ensures comfortability and robustness; depends on the item, calculate on per item basis (both objective cost and subjective cost, i.e., attractiveness and comfort).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Example items that do not satisfy all questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    High-end cell phones: While I'll be using a phone almost every day for the rest of my life, getting the best model doesn't offer many more benefits. I don't need the extra photo/videography features on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11</a> and I'm satisfied with features of the iPhone 7 (my current model (17 August 2020)).
  </li>
  <li>
    Books: I will use the book for a month or so, only to shelve it and possibly reread years later. New books are identical to used books content-wise, yet are much more expensive. Owning some books is important to me, but I generally prefer renting from the library.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="office_chair">Office Chair (18 February 2021)</h4>

<p>
  In August 2020, I purchased a lightly-used <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/">Herman Miller Aeron chair</a>, which is considered one of the best, if not the best, office chair out there. [add benefits]

<h4 id="long_phone_charger">Long Phone Charger (3)</h4>

<p>
  This is a huge convenience, especially when outlets are scarce. I can sit anywhere on any couch in any position in my home and still have my phone charging. I have a 6 ft <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Lightning-Certified-Charger/dp/B013JNUHR0">Anker lightning cable</a>, but longer is generally better.
</p>

<h4 id="portable_charger">Portable Charger (3)</h4>

<p>
  This is nice to have on long excursions (drive, hike, bike, etc) if there isn't a charging port available. I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Anker PowerCore 13000</a>: it's portable and can charge my iPhone 7 3+ times on one charge. It also has multiple USB ports to charge two devices simultaneously.
</p>

<h4 id="alfred_app">Alfred App (7)</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_(software)">Wikipedia</a>) is a productivity app that expedites searching and other processes on macOS.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Internet search</b>: Instead of opening up a browser, opening up a new tab, going to a specific website, then typing in the search, a simple command button + spacebar brings up the Alfred search bar, followed by a command to search specific sites. For example, "w alfred" pulls up Alfred's Wikipedia page and "gr war and peace" searches Goodreads for <i>War and Peace</i>. Search queries are customizable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>File search</b>: Instead of opening Finder and going through many folders to find the file, a simple "Find + [search element name]" in the Alfred search bar finds it immediately. File contents can also be searched for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Other</b>: Perform math, access the dictionary, and control macOS.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="home_gym">Home Gym (10)</h4>

<p>
  I have a relatively-complete home gym setup on my back porch. It consists of (grouped by category, hyperlinks are to suggested products):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Powerlifting: Squat rack, adjustable bench, 45 lb barbell, 255 lb of weights (4x45, 2x35, 2x25, 2x10, 4x5, 2x2.5)
  </li>
  <li>
    Kettlebells: 20, 30 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Dumbbells: 2x20, 2x15, 2x12, 2x10, 2x8, 2x5, 2x3 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Calisthenics: Dip/pull-up tower, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harbinger-Polypropylene-Belt-Steel-Chain/dp/B07TSFBMPN">dip belt</a>, <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-wood-rings">gymnastics rings</a>, <a href="https://chrispconstantlyvaried.blogspot.com/2011/09/crossfit-home-gym-how-to-hang-gymnastic.html?m=1">ceiling mount</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Grip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ur4dQD-MY">Pinch block</a>, <a href="http://www.dieselcrew.com/how-to-make-rotating-thick-grips/">thick grips</a>, <a href="https://www.ironmind.com/product-info/grip-strength-training-tools/captains-of-crush-grippers/">gripper</a>

    150, 35, 60, 30
  </li>
  <li>
    20, 20, 25
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Total cost: $685
</p>

<img src="media/home_gym.png" alt="home_gym" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">

</figcaption>

<p>
  The average commercial gym costs "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/26663228">between $40 and $50 a month</a>" = $480-600 per year = $540 average. The lowest price I've seen is <a href="https://www.planetfitness.com/gym-memberships">Planet Fitness</a> at $10/month = $120/year. The breakeven point is then:
</p>

\[\text{breakeven_avg} = \frac{$685}{$540\text{/yr}} = 1.26 \, \text{yr}\]

\[\text{breakeven_cheap} = \frac{$685}{$12\text{/yr}} = 5.71 \, \text{yr}\]

<p>
  I've had the first bullet point's items (squat rack, bench, etc) for 10 years, meaning I've saved:
</p>

\[\text{saving_avg} = $540/\text{yr} \times 10 \, \text{yr} - $685 = $4,715\]

\[\text{saving_cheap} = $120/\text{yr} \times 10 \, \text{yr} - $685 = $515\]

<p>
  A few more non-financial advantages to a home gym:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Available equipment: Planet Fitness (and many other commercial gyms) don't have free barbells and sometimes allow deadlifting (or at least the other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJmVlt98FLA">patrons</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTpseU5oFfY">don't</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJ_LfgytCw">like</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJTFLR2c1Y">it</a>). Forgot about gymnastics rings, grip tools, or dip belts (however, you can always bring your own).
  </li>
  <li>
    Convenience: No more driving to the gym or making sure to go during business. Simply go to the home gym in 10 seconds at any time. Quick calculation on driving saved (starting from driving age of 16):

    \[\text{miles_saved} = (2-4) \, \text{mi/drive} \times (3-5) \, \text{drive/wk} \times \, 350 \, \text{wk} = (2100-7000) \, \text{mi}\]

    \[\text{gas_money_saved} = (2100-7000) \, \text{mi} \times \frac{1}{20} \, \text{gal/mi} \times $2.50/\text{gal} = $(263 - 875)\]
  </li>
  <li>
    Style: No judgment, no one to tell you you're being too loud or annoying (except maybe the police), you can wear or not wear whatever you want, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Minimalism: Only pay for equipment you want and/or need, not unnecessary amenities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

<h4 id="ad_blocker">Ad Blocker (6)</h4>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock Origin</a>, <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>, and <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a> on Chrome. I now have significantly less <a href="../../knowledge/productivity/productivity.html#distractions">distractions</a> and can focus more on the content I'm consuming.
</p>

<h4 id="natural_light_alarm_clock">Natural Light Alarm Clock (7)</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_simulation">Dawn simulation</a> is a common method to help users wake up more easily and gently than using a standard alarm clock or that god-forsaken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhEz3hqlQE">default iPhone alarm</a>.

<h4 id="additional_monitor">Additional Monitor (10)</h4>

<p>
  I currently use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082BYRR3L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Asus 27" VA27EHE monitor</a> in addition to my 13" Macbook Pro. I previously used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3VV8T4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Sceptre 20" monitor</a>.
</p>

<img src="../../knowledge/productivity/media/desk.jpg" alt="desk" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">
  Current desk set up with 27" Asus monitor and 13" Macbook Pro
</figcaption>

<p>
  This is arguably the most beneficial productivity change I have made. I now effectively have five Macbook-sized screens or two Macbook-width-2x-length screens. I can be working on something on my Macbook screen and quickly reference an article on the monitor without having to minimize or pull an application back up in front of my current application. I can have a video playing and occasionally watch. Working on just my laptop now feels awkward and slow.
</p>

<p>
  I highly recommend adopting a second monitor to everyone.
</p>

<h2 id="behaviors_actions">Behaviors/Actions</h2>



<h4 id="friends">Friends</h4>

<p>
  Friendship should be reciprocal and mutually beneficial: friend A invites friend B to events and takes an interest in his life, while B does the same thing to A. The effort and interest should not be unilateral. I found myself being the sole contributor to quite a few friendships. I was always the one to text first, video chat first, remember important things about them, and so on. I noticed this, so I tried something: I didn't contact those friends for a while to see if they would notice. And they didn't.
</p>

<p>
  Now I no longer have to spend time or energy on dead-end friendships or have any stress in the back of my mind about why they never initiate first.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to note that some people simply lack self-awareness and aren't cognizant that they're being poor friends. I used to be like this until a friend politely set me straight with a "we're always inviting you to stuff, but you never invite us". If you let someone know this and they don't make a better effort, they probably don't want to be your friend.
</p>

<p>
  To organize my friends, I use <a href="https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends">friends</a>, "a command-line program that helps you to keep track of your relationships with the people you care about".
</p>

<h4 id="culture_war">Culture War/Politics (6)</h4>

<p>
  Avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war">culture war</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">politics</a> (I will use culture war to include both) has relieved my mind of a huge burden. There are few positives and many negatives that result. I felt angry at the world and others and scared at the path society was headed down. Yet nothing changed after I removed it from my life. The world didn't explode nor did anything drastic happen like the news and politicians and culture soldiers seemed to predict.
</p>

<p>
  I asked my <a href="#one_on_one">one-on-one partner</a> his opinion and he gave me an excellent heuristic for consuming this type of media: only listen or read about it if 1) it will still be talked about in 100 years, and 2) it affects you.
</p>

<p>
  This is not to say I bury my head in the sand. I do attempt to stay informed about <i>major</i> events, but everything else the media blows out of proportion, sucking readers down the black hole of negativity and hatred.
</p>

<p>
  Some concrete steps I took to remove culture war from my life:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Blocked users on Twitter if the majority of their posts were culture war-ish. Some people, like <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg">Paul Graham</a>, occasionally post culture war content, but it's far and in between enough that I am able to ignore it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unsubscribed to all possible culture war sources in my life: subreddits (r/worldnews, r/news), newsletters, don't go on news websites anymore. I still subscribe to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/">r/TheMotte</a>, but don't visit their culture war thread. I figure that if news is big enough, I will hear it from a friend, family member, or through another source.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't engage in any discussions related to culture war. A few of my friends enjoy (how?) discussing those types of topics, which is fine, but not something I want to be a part of. I simply stop talking, change the subject, or leave the room altogether. Nobody's mind will change and people will simply dig their trenches even deeper without truly listening to the other side. Generally unproductive and divisive.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="one_on_one">One-on-Ones (8)</h4>

<p>
  Main post here (will update when I finish it).
</p>

<p>
  I meet with my 1:1 partner every week for around an hour. We discuss the past week's goals and experiences, ask each other questions and give feedback, and plan out the upcoming week. This provides a few benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I am held accountable for tasks by my partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    I get a second perspective on ideas, plans, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    I learn information I would likely not have learned otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="twitter">Twitter (01 March 2021)</h4>

<h4 id="journaling">Journaling</h4>

<h4 id="website_ing">Website-ing (10)</h4>

<p>
  I originally got this idea from Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now</a>. I wholeheartedly agree with virtually every point made in that post.
</p>

<p>
  I view my website as my personal knowledge database (Guzey has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWg06inYdM">video</a> on this). I can write about things that interest me all while learning more about them, all while allowing for easy reference as long as I have internet access or am at my laptop. I can keep track of the links I've read, quotes I like, and thoughts I have in one organized place and manner.
</p>

<h4 id="cold_showers">Cold Showers (4)</h4>

<p>
  These are touted by many (you probably have heard of the biggest proponents) to have magical effects: they <a href="https://mrmindblowing.com/cold-shower-benefits/">supposedly</a> boost testosterone; are healthy for skin; strengthen immunity; increase blood circulation; help in weight loss; boost confidence; make you feel good; increase alertness; and increase hearth health.
</p>

<p>
  In order of supposed benefits: no testosterone test ever done, so I can't compare differences; I generally don't have acne; I have not been sick in the past 5-8 years, besides food poisoning; no blood circulation measurement available, but reasonable; I've done a few cuts, but they're generally small; I'm naturally confident; subjective, but yes; I am more awake after a cold shower; no measurement available.
</p>

<p>
  Another claimed benefit is increased willpower because of how difficult a cold shower is. It takes willpower to turn the water away from the comfortable warm. This in turn decreases the difficulty of future tasks that are generally unpleasant. I haven't noticed a difference with this.
</p>

<p>
  People often ask about using cold showers to improve cold water tolerance. While cold water still feels cold, the relaxation methods I've learned in ice-cold showers has helped when jumping in ~40 °F = 4 °C alpine lakes.
</p>

<p>
  I may do a literature review on cold showers in the future.
