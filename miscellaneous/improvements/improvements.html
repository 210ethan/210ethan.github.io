<h1 id="life_improvements">Life Improvements</h1>

<p>
  Below are a list of items and practices (with descriptions and explanations) that have noticeably improved my life. Some are complete, while other are awaiting for an appropriate amount of time to pass before giving feedback.
</p>

<h2 id="items">Items</h2>

<p>
  My lifestyle is quite frugal: I only go out to eat on rare occasions with friends; I spend money on clothes maybe once a year, and even then it is normally second-hand; I don't own any flashy jewelry or extravagant sneakers.
</p>

<p>
  When I want to purchase something, the yes/no decision and amount I'm willing to spend (price doesn't always correlate with quality) depends on the answer to a few questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How long will I be using this? If I'll be using the item for many years, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon. This is known as buying for life, which has its own subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/">r/BuyItForLife</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    How often will I be using this? If I'll be using the item every day, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Does this bring any benefit to my life? Why should I purchase something that brings no benefit to my life, lasting or fleeting?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do others say about this? The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68143.The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">wisdom of crowds</a> is generally reliable, especially on communities dedicated to the item's subject, i.e., mattresses or footwear. Those crowds, which likely include experts, are extremely knowledgable on the subject and will provide trustworthy suggestions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will it pay for itself? I view this by dividing the cost by the number of hours spent using this or, in applicable cases, the breakeven point of renting vs. buying (buying a suit for $1000 is worth it if you need to wear it on 6 occasions and renting costs $200/occasion). If the answer to the first two questions are yes, then this question's answer is likely yes.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Example items that satisfy all or most questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mattress: I'll be using a mattress almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through high-quality sleep; many recommend high-quality mattresses; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Footwear: I'll be wearing shoes almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through comfortable walking and standing; many recommend high-quality footwear; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vehicle: I'll be driving a car almost every day for the next 50 years; it brings great benefit through quick, easy, and comfortable transportation; seeing people have to pay exorbitant maintenance fees on their European cars is enough to turn me on to Japanese-branded vehicles; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clothing: I'll be wearing clothes every day for the rest of my life; it brings benefit through feeling comfortable and looking good; others agree that low-quality clothing easily falls apart—spending extra money on high-quality clothing ensures comfortability and robustness; depends on the item, calculate on per item basis (both objective cost and subjective cost, i.e., attractiveness and comfort).
  </li>
</ul>

  Example items that do not satisfy all questions:
