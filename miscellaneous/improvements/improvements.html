<h1 id="improvements">Life Improvements</h1>

<p>
  Created: 17 August 2020 / Finished: 27 August 2020
</p>

<p>
  Below are a list of items and practices with descriptions and explanations that have noticeably improved my quality of life or have been said to improve quality of life. Some are complete, while others are awaiting for an appropriate amount of time to pass before giving feedback. Those awaiting feedback are marked with the tentative date I will provide feedback.
</p>

<p>
  Both items and practices have a number in the title indicating the benefit on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is negligible and 10 is my life is incredibly better with it, I am much happier because of it, etc. These are entirely subjective.
</p>

<p>
  Please <a href="../../about/about_me/about_me.html#contact">contact me</a> if you have a life improvement suggestion or experience with any of these. I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences and am always looking for ways to improve my life.

<h3 id="items_philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p>
  My lifestyle is quite frugal: I only go out to eat on rare occasions with friends; I spend money on clothes maybe once a year, and even then it is normally second-hand; I don't own any flashy jewelry or extravagant sneakers.
</p>

<p>
  When I want to purchase something, the yes/no decision and amount I'm willing to spend (price doesn't always correlate with quality) depends on the answer to a few questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How long will I be using this? If I'll be using the item for many years, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon. This is known as buying for life, which has its own subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/">r/BuyItForLife</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    How often will I be using this? If I'll be using the item every day, I want to make sure it is reliable and I won't have to replace it anytime soon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Does this bring any benefit to my life? Why should I purchase something that brings no benefit to my life, lasting or fleeting?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do others say about this? The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68143.The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">wisdom of crowds</a> is generally reliable, especially on communities dedicated to the item's subject, i.e., mattresses or footwear. Those crowds, which likely include experts, are extremely knowledgable on the subject and will provide trustworthy suggestions. I like to search Reddit before making a major purchase.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will it pay for itself? I view this by dividing the cost by the number of hours spent using this or, in applicable cases, the breakeven point of renting vs. buying (buying a suit for $1000 is worth it if you need to wear it on 6 occasions and renting costs $200/occasion). If the answer to the first two questions are yes, then this question's answer is likely yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Is there a cheaper option that doesn't sacrifice (much) quality? If the quality of item A is 10/10 and costs $1000, while the quality of item B is 8/10 and costs $500, item B is likely a better option.
  </li>
</ol>

  <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/indestructible-nokia-3310">Nokia 3310</a>: The original buy-it-for-life product
</figcaption>

<p>
  Example items that satisfy all or most questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mattress: I'll be using a mattress almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through high-quality sleep; many recommend high-quality mattresses; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Footwear: I'll be wearing shoes almost every day for the rest of my life; it brings great benefit through comfortable walking and standing; many recommend high-quality footwear; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vehicle: I'll be driving a car almost every day for the next 50 years; it brings great benefit through quick, easy, and comfortable transportation; seeing people have to pay exorbitant maintenance fees on their European cars is enough to turn me on to Japanese-branded vehicles; yes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clothing: I'll be wearing clothes every day for the rest of my life; it brings benefit through feeling comfortable and looking good; others agree that low-quality clothing easily falls apart—spending extra money on high-quality clothing ensures comfortability and robustness; depends on the item, calculate on per item basis (both objective cost and subjective cost, i.e., attractiveness and comfort).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Example items that do not satisfy all questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    High-end cell phones: While I'll be using a phone almost every day for the rest of my life, getting the best model doesn't offer many more benefits. I don't need the extra photo/videography features on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11</a> and I'm satisfied with features of the iPhone 7 (my current model (17 August 2020)).
  </li>
  <li>
    Books: I will use the book for a month or so, only to shelve it and possibly reread years later. New books are identical to used books content-wise, yet are much more expensive. Owning some books is important to me, but I generally rent from the library.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="home_gym">Home Gym (10)</h3>

<p>
  I have a relatively-complete home gym setup on my parents' back porch. It consists of the following (grouped by category):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Powerlifting: Squat rack, adjustable bench, 45 lb barbell, 255 lb of weights (4x45, 2x35, 2x25, 2x10, 4x5, 2x2.5)
  </li>
  <li>
    Kettlebells: 20, 30 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Dumbbells: 2x20, 2x15, 2x12, 2x10, 2x8, 2x5, 2x3 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Calisthenics: Dip/pull-up tower, dip belt, gymnastics rings, <a href="https://chrispconstantlyvaried.blogspot.com/2011/09/crossfit-home-gym-how-to-hang-gymnastic.html?m=1">ceiling mount</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Grip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ur4dQD-MY">Pinch block</a>, <a href="http://www.dieselcrew.com/how-to-make-rotating-thick-grips/">thick grips</a>, <a href="https://www.ironmind.com/product-info/grip-strength-training-tools/captains-of-crush-grippers/">gripper</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Cost per item ($):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    150 + 60 (2x45 lb plates)
  </li>
  <li>
    10, 15
  </li>
  <li>
    46, 34, 28, 24, 18, 12, 8
  </li>
  <li>
    150, 35, 60, 30
  </li>
  <li>
    20, 20, 25
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Total cost: $685
</p>

<img src="media/home_gym.png" alt="home_gym" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">
  Current home gym setup (dip/pull-up tower behind camera)
</figcaption>

<p>
  The average commercial gym costs "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/26663228">between $40 and $50 a month</a>" = $480-600 per year = $540 average. The lowest price I've seen is <a href="https://www.planetfitness.com/gym-memberships">Planet Fitness</a> at $10/month = $120/year. The breakeven point is then:
</p>

\[\text{breakeven_avg} = \frac{$685}{$540\text{/yr}} = 1.26 \, \text{yr}\]

\[\text{breakeven_cheap} = \frac{$685}{$12\text{/yr}} = 5.71 \, \text{yr}\]

<p>
  I've had the first bullet point's items (squat rack, bench, etc) for 10 years, meaning I've saved:
</p>

\[\text{saving_avg} = $540/\text{yr} \times 10 \, \text{yr} - $685 = $4,715\]

\[\text{saving_cheap} = $120/\text{yr} \times 10 \, \text{yr} - $685 = $515\]

<p>
  A few more non-financial advantages to a home gym:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Available equipment: Planet Fitness (and many other commercial gyms) don't have free barbells and sometimes allow deadlifting (or at least the other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJmVlt98FLA">patrons</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTpseU5oFfY">don't</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJ_LfgytCw">like</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWJTFLR2c1Y">it</a>). Forgot about gymnastics rings, grip tools, or dip belts (however, you can always bring your own).
  </li>
  <li>
    Convenience: No more driving to the gym or making sure to go during business hours. Simply go to the home gym in 10 seconds at any time. Quick calculations on driving and time saved (starting from driving age of 16):

    \[\text{miles_saved} = (2-4) \, \text{mi/drive} \times (3-5) \, \text{drive/wk} \times 350 \, \text{wk} = (2100-7000) \, \text{mi}\]

    \[\text{gas_money_saved} = (2100-7000) \, \text{mi} \times \frac{1}{20} \, \text{gal/mi} \times $2.50/\text{gal} = $(263 - 875)\]

    \[\text{time_saved} = (5-15) \, \text{min/drive} \times 2 \, \text{drive/day} \times (3-5) \, \text{day/wk} \times 50 \, \text{wk/yr} = (25-125) \, \text{hr/yr}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    Style: No judgment, no one to tell you you're being too loud or annoying (except maybe the police and neighbors), you can wear or not wear whatever you want, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Minimalism: Only pay for equipment you want and/or need, not unnecessary amenities.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="additional_monitor">Additional Monitor (10)</h3>

<p>
  I currently use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082BYRR3L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Asus 27" VA27EHE monitor</a> in addition to my 13" Macbook Pro. I previously used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3VV8T4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Sceptre 20" monitor</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This is arguably the most beneficial productivity change I have made. I now effectively have five MacBook-sized screens or two MacBook-width-2x-length screens. I can be working on something on my MacBook screen and quickly reference an article on the monitor without having to minimize or pull an application back up in front of my current application. I can have a video playing and occasionally watch. I can have both! Working on just my laptop now feels awkward and slow. I highly recommend adopting a second monitor to everyone.
</p>

<h3 id="alfred_app">Alfred App (7)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_(software)">Wikipedia</a>) is a productivity app that expedites searching and other processes on macOS.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Internet search</b>: Instead of opening up a browser, opening up a new tab, going to a specific website, then typing in the search, a simple command button + spacebar brings up the Alfred search bar, followed by a command to search specific sites. For example, "w alfred" pulls up Alfred's Wikipedia page and "gr war and peace" searches Goodreads for <i>War and Peace</i>. Search queries are customizable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>File search</b>: Instead of opening Finder and going through many folders to find the file, a simple "Find + [search element name]" in the Alfred search bar finds it immediately. File contents can also be searched for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Other</b>: Perform math, access the dictionary, and control macOS.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See approximate time saved using Alfred <a href="../../knowledge/productivity/productivity.html#reduction">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="xbox">Xbox (7)</h3>

<p>
  Despite video games being largely considered unproductive, I've found my Xbox to be incredibly valuable in maintaining certain friendships and even creating other ones. Due to distance limitations (me living a few hours away from some friends), Xbox allows me to talk and play with friends I wouldn't otherwise interact with as much.
</p>

<p>
  Playing video games is also fun and a good way to end a long and/or stressful day.
</p>

<h3 id="natural_light_alarm_clock">Natural Light Alarm Clock (6)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_simulation">Dawn simulation</a> is a common method to help users wake up more easily and gently than using a standard alarm clock or that god-forsaken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhEz3hqlQE">default iPhone alarm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  See the following studies: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11513820/">Avery et al. 2001</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8731073/">Wirz-Justice et al. 1995</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="ad_blocker">Ad Blocker (6)</h3>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock Origin</a>, <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>, and <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a> on Chrome. I now have significantly less <a href="../../knowledge/productivity/productivity.html#distractions">distractions</a> and can focus more on the content I'm consuming.
</p>

<h3 id="long_phone_charger">Long Phone Charger (3)</h3>

<p>
  This is a huge convenience, especially when outlets are scarce. I can sit anywhere on any couch in any position in my home and still have my phone charging. I have a 6 ft <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Lightning-Certified-Charger/dp/B013JNUHR0">Anker lightning cable</a>, but longer is generally better.
</p>

<h3 id="portable_charger">Portable Charger (3)</h3>

<p>
  This is nice to have on long excursions (drive, hike, bike, etc) if there isn't a charging port available. I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Anker PowerCore 13000</a>: it's portable and can charge my iPhone 7 3+ times on one charge. It also has multiple USB ports to charge two devices simultaneously.
</p>

<h3 id="office_chair">Office Chair (18 February 2021)</h3>

<p>
  I use a <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/">Herman Miller Aeron chair</a>, which is considered one of the, if not the, best office chairs out there due to ergonomics and durability.

<h2 id="practices">Practices</h2>

<h3 id="practices_philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p>
  When adopting or abandoning a practice, I ask two questions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Will this benefit me? Will I become happier, healthier, more productive, more knowledgable, or some other positive trait?
  </li>
  <li>
    Will this damage me? Will I become less happy, ..., or some other negative trait?
  </li>
  <li>
    How much effort does this take? You are less likely to perform actions that take significant effort, meaning everything should be as close to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/zero/">zero-effort</a> as possible. If it takes significant effort, its benefits must be proportional (or find another method).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Once I answer these questions, I weigh the answers against each other. All new practices are given an indeterminate testing period where I can decide if I like it and if it's beneficial for me to continue using.
</p>

<h3 id="website_ing">Website-ing (10)</h3>

<p>
  I originally got this idea from Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now</a>. I wholeheartedly agree with virtually every point made in that post. (Many thanks to Guzey for the post and my <a href="#one_on_one">one-on-one partner</a> for spurring me to actually start it.)
</p>

<p>
  I view my website as my personal knowledge database (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWg06inYdM">video</a>). I can write about things that interest me all while learning more about them, all while allowing for easy reference as long as I have internet access or am at my laptop. I can keep track of the links I've read, quotes I like, and thoughts I have in one organized place and manner.
</p>

<p>
  The website also serves as a beacon for like-minded people to connect with me. While I rarely link it in public forums, I have gotten a few cold emails from people saying they find my posts interesting.
</p>

<h3 id="one_on_one">One-on-Ones (8)</h3>

<p>
  Main post here (will update when I finish it).
</p>

<p>
  I meet with my 1:1 partner every week for around an hour. We discuss the past week's goals and experiences, ask each other questions and give feedback, and plan out the upcoming week. This provides a few benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I am held accountable for tasks by my partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    I get a second perspective on ideas, plans, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    I learn information I would likely not have learned otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="comparison">Comparison (7)</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> is attributed with the quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Comparison is the thief of joy
</blockquote>

<p>
  I've found that comparing "up" (smarter, wealthier, more attractive, etc.) often confirms Roosevelt's quote, so I avoid that at all costs. I've come to terms that everyone is born with different circumstances: rich, poor; smart, stupid; attractive, ugly; tall, short. I only give presence of mind to things that I can control, and discard anything that is out of my control.
</p>

<p>
  However, the other comparison option often negates the quote: comparing "down".
</p>

<p>
  As I'm writing this article, I'm sitting in an extremely comfortable <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/">chair</a> typing on an expensive laptop with a second monitor next to me in an air-conditioned home with a roof on it in a safe neighborhood with a beautiful park across the street from me and my own, paid-off car in the driveway. In two weeks, I will start a stable, fulfilling job that allows me to pay for a nice apartment and pursue hobbies I enjoy. I will never have to worry about paying for food or other necessities because of my family's support system. I graduated from a top-15 engineering university with debt-free.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, I see some drowning in student loans that will take decades to pay off, living on ramen noodles because of tight budgets, and having to take public transit because they can't afford a car. (Please note I am in no way making fun of less fortunate people, but just using them to make myself aware of how fortunate I am to be born into the family and situation I was. My situation could always and easily be worse.)
</p>

<p>
  I make similar comparisons on a daily basis whenever possible, whether by trigger or voluntary thinking, thereby greatly increasing my gratitude and <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/roosevelt-was-wrong-comparison-is-not-the-thief-of-joy-9e490cd6225">life satisfaction</a>. A few examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Driving on a hot summer day, I see someone waiting for my city's terribly-inefficient public bus. They have to spend an extra 1-2 hours getting to a place that takes me 15 minutes by car with air-conditioning. (Remember, time is the <a href="../../thoughts/time_optimization/time_optimization.html">most valuable asset</a>.)
  </li>
  <li>
    I see people struggling with student loans. I am extremely lucky to have graduated debt-free.
  </li>
  <li>
    I see people online talking about lay-offs and difficulty in finding a job. The company I work for rarely, if ever, lays off, despite being in an extremely cyclical industry.
  </li>
  <li>
    I hear cases of abusive and/or neglectful parents. My parents are unconditionally affectionate, supportive, and understanding.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal">Gratitude journaling</a> is another option that allows looking back on old thoughts and to be a bit more expressive.
</p>

<h3 id="culture_war">Culture War/Politics (6)</h3>

<p>
  Avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war">culture war</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">politics</a> (I will use culture war to include both) has relieved my mind of a huge burden. There are few positives and many negatives that result. I felt angry at the world and others and scared at the path society was headed down. Yet nothing changed after I removed it from my life. The world didn't explode nor did anything drastic happen like the news and politicians and culture soldiers seemed to predict.
</p>

<p>
  I asked my <a href="#one_on_one">one-on-one partner</a> his opinion and he gave me an excellent heuristic for consuming this type of media (and news in general): only listen or read about it if 1) it will still be talked about in 100 years, and 2) it affects you. This is not to say I bury my head in the sand. I do attempt to stay informed about <i>major</i> events, but everything else the media blows out of proportion, sucking readers down the black hole of negativity and hatred. If news is big enough, I will hear it from a friend, family member, or another source.
</p>

<p>
  Some concrete steps I took to remove culture war from my life:
</p>

  <li>
    Social media: Blocked users on Twitter if the majority of their posts were culture war-ish. Some users occasionally post culture war content, but it's far and in between enough that I am able to ignore it. I unfriended people on Facebook who posted too much culture war content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unsubscribed to and stopped visiting all possible culture war sources in my life: subreddits (r/worldnews, r/news), newsletters,  news websites anymore. I still subscribe to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/">r/TheMotte</a>, but don't visit their culture war thread.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't engage in any discussions related to culture war. A few of my friends enjoy (how?) discussing those types of topics, which is fine, but it's not something I want to be a part of. I simply stop talking, change the subject, or leave the room altogether. Nobody's mind will change and people will simply dig their trenches even deeper without truly listening to the other side. Generally unproductive and divisive.

<h3 id="spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition (6)</h3>

<p>
  See my post <a href="../../knowledge/srs/srs.html">here</a> for literature and information suggestions.
</p>

<p>
  Spaced repetition is an incredibly efficient way of memorizing vast amounts of information. I can almost instantly recall periodic table information, countries and their capitals, poems, and a host of other useful and fun information.
</p>

<h3 id="friends">Friends (5)</h3>

<p>
  Friendship should be reciprocal and mutually beneficial: friend A invites friend B to events and takes an interest in his life, while B does the same thing to A. The effort and interest should not be unilateral. I found myself being the sole contributor to quite a few friendships. I was always the one to text first, video chat first, remember important things about them, and so on. I noticed this, so I tried something: I didn't contact those friends for a while to see if they would notice. And they didn't.
</p>

<p>
  Now I no longer have to spend time or energy on dead-end friendships or have any stress in the back of my mind about why they never initiate first.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to note that some people simply lack self-awareness and aren't cognizant that they're being poor friends. I used to be like this until a friend politely set me straight with a "we're always inviting you to stuff, but you never invite us". If you let someone know this and they don't make a better effort, they probably don't want to be your friend.
</p>

<h4 id="friend_manager">Friend Manager (7)</h4>

<p>
  To organize my friends, I use <a href="https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends">friends</a>, "a command-line program that helps you to keep track of your relationships with the people you care about". It's very useful for making sure you are maintaining all relationships that are important to you, not just your best friends. You can keep track of activites and take notes.
</p>

<h3 id="social_media">Social Media (5)</h3>

<p>
  Social media is largely signaling. Users only post the highlights of their life, giving off the false idea that their life is filled with entirely good times and no bad times. This is important to understand and accept.
</p>

<h4 id="facebook">Facebook</h4>

<p>
  I look at Facebook two ways. On the positive side, it's a great way to keep up with friends, family, and acquaintances who you otherwise don't talk to but are still interested in their life (provided they post updates). On the negative side, some people say that if you really cared about keeping up with those people, you wouldn't need Facebook to do so. I find this argument flawed, as it's virtually impossible to maintain a meaningful relationship with that many people.
</p>

<h4 id="snapchat">Snapchat</h4>

<p>
  Snapchat has helped me maintain friendships with a small amount of effort.

<h3 id="cold_showers">Cold Showers (4)</h3>

<p>
  These are touted by many (you probably have heard of the biggest proponents) to have magical effects: they <a href="https://mrmindblowing.com/cold-shower-benefits/">supposedly</a> boost testosterone; are healthy for skin; strengthen immunity; increase blood circulation; help in weight loss; boost confidence; make you feel good; increase alertness; and increase heart health.
</p>

<p>
  In order of supposed benefits: no testosterone test ever done, so I can't compare differences; I generally don't have acne nowadays, but did when I was a teenager; I have not been sick in the past 5-8 years, besides food poisoning; no blood circulation measurement available, but reasonable benefit; I've done a few cuts, but they're generally small; I'm naturally confident; subjective, but yes; I am more awake after a cold shower; no measurement available.
</p>

<p>
  Another claimed benefit is increased willpower because of how difficult a cold shower is. It takes willpower to turn the water away from the comfortable warm. This in turn decreases the difficulty of future tasks that are generally unpleasant. I haven't noticed a difference with this.
</p>

<p>
  People often ask about using cold showers to improve cold water tolerance. While cold water still feels cold, the relaxation methods I've learned in ice-cold showers has helped when jumping in 40 °F = 4 °C alpine lakes.
