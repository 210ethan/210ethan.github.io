        <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy">How to Be Happy</a>: Discusses what correlates with happiness (physical attractiveness doesn't very much, while relationship and work satisfaction do), as well as concrete methods for becoming happier. They all boil down to working on yourself: increasing extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, self-esteem, and optimism are all likely to make you happier. [!psychology]

    <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JHcTP4Ad8QAmRTCZm/be-happier">Be Happier</a>: Similar to lukeprog's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy">How to Be Happy</a> post (see directly above), this also examines literature in hopes of finding how to achieve happiness. The author provides a "Nutshell" summary, then begins quoting various studies supporting each point. Money, work satisfaction, materialism and purchasing, interpersonal relationships, and appreciation and how they relate to happiness are all discussed. Some of my favorite points: "Don’t be stingy. It's bad for your health.", "Set goals that are reasonably challenging and reasonably achievable.", "Prefer experiential purchases; avoid materialistic goals.", "Associate with happy people.", "Go for smaller, more frequent successes rather than larger ones.".

    <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/11/">The unreasonable effectiveness of one-on-ones</a>: A great write-up of how one-on-ones improved the author's SO's life and his management style.

    <a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight">Twitching with Twight</a>: One of Mark Twight's most famous essays, basically telling you to screw the recipe life ("mix one high school diploma with an undergrad degree … a poorly built house in a cul de sac … working for a board that doesn't give a shit about you") and live how you want. I first read this in his book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=9j21sBL4Te&rank=1">Kiss or Kill</a>.

    <a href="https://narratively.com/the-man-with-the-golden-airline-ticket/">The Man with the Golden Airline Ticket</a>: The story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAirpass">American Airlines AAirpass</a> and Steven Rothstein's experience using it. For just $250,000, the cardholder can fly an unlimited amount of miles for as long as they live—no catch. For an extra $150,000, the cardholder can add a travel companion with the same privileges. AA grossly underestimated Rothstein's yearly travel, eventually finding a loophole in the terms and conditions to revoke his pass due to so-called fraudulent behavior (Rothstein would offer strangers to be his designated companion, leaving AA out of one ticket—this added up).
