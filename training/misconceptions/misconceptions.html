<h1 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions in Exercise</h1>

<p>
  Exercise is plagued with common misconceptions and/or poor information. This page clears some of these up. All titles are stated in the "incorrect form", e.g., "Stunting Growth - Gymnastics" means that gymnastic does <i>not</i> stunt growth.

<h3 id="gymnastics">Gymnastics</h3>

<p>
  Most gymnasts are short because of a simple filtering effect: the shorter the gymnast, the more advantage they have. Larger power-to-weight ratios

<p>
  The 2013 paper <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3751410/"><i>Role of Intensive Training in the Growth and Maturation of Artistic Gymnasts</i></a> addresses this question.
</p>

<p>
  The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) asked four questions related to the relationship between stunted growth and gymnastics training:
</p>

<blockquote>
  (1) Is there a negative effect of training on attained adult stature? (2) Is there a negative effect of training on growth of body segments? (3) Does training attenuate pubertal growth and maturation, specifically, the rate of growth and/ or the timing and tempo of maturation? (4) Does training negatively influence the endocrine system, specifically hormones related to growth and pubertal maturation?
</blockquote>

<p>
  The study concluded (from the abstract):
</p>

<blockquote>
  Gymnasts as a group demonstrated a pattern of growth and maturation similar to that observed among short-, normal-, late-maturing individuals who were not athletes. Evidence for endocrine changes in gymnasts was inadequate for inferences relative to potential training effects. Allowing for noted limitations, the following conclusions were deemed acceptable: (1) Adult height or near adult height of female and male artistic gymnasts is not compromised by intensive gymnastics training. (2) Gymnastics training does not appear to attenuate growth of upper (sitting height) or lower (legs) body segment lengths. (3) Gymnastics training does not appear to attenuate pubertal growth and maturation, neither rate of growth nor the timing and tempo of the growth spurt. (4) Available data are inadequate to address the issue of intensive gymnastics training and alterations within the endocrine system.
