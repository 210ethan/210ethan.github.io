    <a href="https://www.backfitpro.com/documents/RehabtoEnhancing.pdf">Designing Back Exercise: from Rehabilitation to Enhancing Performance</a>: First and foremost, the cause of the back pain should be found, and only then exercise prescribed to treat the cause with the dose and intensity specific to the person. Stages of therapeutic exercises:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Corrective exercise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Groove appropriate and perfect motion and motor patterns. Encode movement engrams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build whole body and joint stability (mobility at some joints such as the hips and stability through the lumbar spine).
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase endurance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build strength and develop speed, power, agility.

    <a href="https://myojournal.com/rethinking-proximity-to-failure-for-strength-gains/">Rethinking Proximity to Failure for Strength Gains</a>: Key takeaways:
    <blockquote>
      We make the argument that the force production of a repetition is a vital and often underemphasized aspect to training specificity for maximal strength. Training with heavy loads and low intraset fatigue/velocity loss results in force production the most specific to a 1RM.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      For short to moderate term strength gains, performing sets to or close to failure doesn’t offer an additional training effect but can cause other detrimental changes. We also discuss the interplay between muscle growth and proximity to failure for long term strength gains.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The available research suggests that when training with 65-85% of 1RM, staying far from failure allows for the accumulation of repetitions that provide the majority of the strength stimulus. This means that sets can be terminated before large decreases in bar velocity occur (roughly 10-20% velocity loss) while still maximizing the strength stimulus. We also recommend incorporating regular heavy top sets (>85% of 1RM) for skill practice at velocities similar to a 1RM.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Maximizing exposure to high force production is an important aspect to specificity for strength gains. While using greater loads increases force production, it is not practical to accumulate all of the required volume with very high loads. When load is dropped for “volume work,” minimizing intraset fatigue by avoiding close proximities to failure provides the greatest return on investment.
    </blockquote>
    The practical applications section at the end is important. [!weightlifting]

    <a href="https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/recovering-from-an-injury-embrace-the-process/">Recovering From an Injury: Embrace the Process</a>: Pain is not just a functon of tissue damage. It's also comprised of psychological and societal factors. We should not be afraid of the injury, nor the movement(s) that caused it, but rather accept the injury itself and begin working on remediation. "An increase in symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you are doing more harm or experiencing a new setback."
    <blockquote>
      As an injured area starts feeling better, the temptation to jump back into normal training becomes almost irresistible. However, at this point the concepts of load management are as critical as ever, because there is likely a period of deconditioning that occurs following an injury due to a decrease in performance levels. Returning to normal training without doing the necessary work to build back up to that level of training is associated with increased risk of injury due to a relative ‘spike’ in workload and can potentially be detrimental.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The process will not be easy, there will be setbacks, and there will be days where you feel defeated. Don’t let that discourage you. As long as you keep showing up and putting in the necessary work, you will get back to baseline and far beyond.

    <a href="https://mennohenselmans.com/cns-fatigue/">3 CNS Fatigue Myths</a>: The truth is: 1) low-intensity, high-duration exercise causes more fatigue than the opposite (high-I, low-D), 2) More compounded lifts, like the deadlift, do not necessarily cause more CNS fatigue, and 3) CNS recovers quickly (10-20 min).
