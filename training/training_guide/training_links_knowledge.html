    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ludmila.soboleva.144/">Ludmila Soboleva</a>: A circus coach based out of Ukraine (I think, may be Russia or Belarus). Some of the strongest young handbalancers I've seen. Some example videos are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hQx2KAgdv/">spiral OAHS hops</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B88raplgsHU/">handstand tightrope walking</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7QkeWLAKIM/">OAHS on head of tightroper</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B16BIEYDbwb/">HS jumproping</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzRhdvADNpv/">collection of HS</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqhayXjCwE-/">Mexican HS</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByFxCDNLBBo">342 Stalder presses</a>. Truly impressive strength and endurance. To simply stand on the hands for 50+ min is impressive, but to maintain balance AND press is an entirely different beast.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.allthingsgym.com/diy-ring-training-dream-machine-pulley-system/">DIY Dream Machine</a>: Tutorial on how to create a Dream Machine for gymnastics rings, which effectively reduces your bodyweight by half through a pulley mechanism. Useful for training more advanced skills.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEC7X1FUIg">501 kg deadlift</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haf%C3%BE%C3%B3r_J%C3%BAl%C3%ADus_Bj%C3%B6rnsson">Hafþór (Hafthor) Björnsson</a>, the heaviest ever. 500 kg was the previous record held by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Hall">Eddie Hall</a> and he <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/eddie-hall-nearly-died-after-passing-out-following-new-deadlift-world-record-of-500kg-a7132306.html">almost died</a>.

    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1xGYN9t4njvHvTEF2woUxDL6meMhQaBTElSvJcqyAf3Y/edit?hl=en&hl=en">4:01 mile training log</a> of Steve Magness, a high-schooler who ran 4:01 for a full mile. Goes to show the time commitment and dedication require.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GECFxAq9CBY">105 pull-ups in a single set</a>: Most pull-ups I've ever seen done in a single set without a single arm hang (which makes it significantly easier). His 8 year-old son did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ual_TtbQ7Q&t=77s">53 pull-ups</a>—like father, like son.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=5017644">1500m Training Plan</a>: A suggested training plan for a "pure 1500 athlete with the aim of a 3.36 ish". From the training logs I've seen of competitive 1500/milers, the volume is correct.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaH_HUMooyM">Biceps tendon strength and rehab/prehab</a>: Naterman discusses the German hang and planche work and their straight arm strength requirements. The video's description is required reading. Naterman now runs <a href="https://labcoatfitness.com/">Lab Coat Fitness</a> with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yaadmohammad/?hl=en">Yaad Mohammad</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=5297805">Mental toughness in running</a>: LetsRun users discuss developing mental toughness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://projectmythology.blogspot.com/">Project Mythology</a>: One of the fittest dudes I've seen (outside of elite-level Crossfitters). He used to be a regular on <a href="https://sealfit.com/">SEALFIT</a> before it went downhill.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=2669719">Sub 1:50 800m Training</a>: What it takes to become an elite-level 800m runner. For those that don't know, the 800 is the man's race.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/soft-tissue-work-for-tough-guys">Soft Tissue Work for Tough Guys</a>: How to use a foam roller/lacrosse ball for self-myofascial release. I found foam rolling to be very beneficial when I was running cross country. 10 minutes a day while watching TV or YouTube can do wonders for training.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_zzkn1-wR0dRFNLT0tXTVlUN3FyZGpiVWRBNld0dw/edit?pli=1">The Updated Training Wisdom of John Kellogg</a>: Kellogg was a long-distance running coach. This document compiled message board posts, articles, and other information put out by Kellogg. Great resource for competitive runners.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=2765071">Running the 800 on pure hate</a>: By and large the best strategy for running the 800 m race.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ANPQkJI3r/">FL to Victorian Cross</a>: Arguably the strongest move ever achieved thus far. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfsorRm-AA8">Zanetti</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/--U_mgXrYbY?t=246">Van Gelder</a> are also extremely difficult, but have been achieved by many. This has only been achieved by Caruso, albeit not many train Victorian strength. See below for not-yet-achieved ring elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUuOvWJdZ8A">10 STRENGTH ELEMENTS Never Done Before on RINGS</a>: Inverted butterfly (inverted hang to inverted cross to handstand) and inverted Zanetti (front lever to Victorian Cross to reverse planche) are arguably the most difficult, with the latter being highly improbable (it took this long just to get FL to VC, and no one can do a perfect reverse planche, much less press into it). Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yElLMbilg0g">here</a> of reversed footage of a negative inverted butterfly (the gymnast is going from HS to IH).
