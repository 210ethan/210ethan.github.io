    <a href="https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/recovering-from-an-injury-embrace-the-process/">Recovering From an Injury: Embrace the Process</a>: Pain is not just a functon of tissue damage. It's also comprised of psychological and societal factors. We should not be afraid of the injury, nor the movement(s) that caused it, but rather accept the injury itself and begin working on remediation. "An increase in symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you are doing more harm or experiencing a new setback."
    <blockquote>
      As an injured area starts feeling better, the temptation to jump back into normal training becomes almost irresistible. However, at this point the concepts of load management are as critical as ever, because there is likely a period of deconditioning that occurs following an injury due to a decrease in performance levels. Returning to normal training without doing the necessary work to build back up to that level of training is associated with increased risk of injury due to a relative ‘spike’ in workload and can potentially be detrimental.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The process will not be easy, there will be setbacks, and there will be days where you feel defeated. Don’t let that discourage you. As long as you keep showing up and putting in the necessary work, you will get back to baseline and far beyond.

    <a href="https://mennohenselmans.com/cns-fatigue/">3 CNS Fatigue Myths</a>: The truth is: 1) low-intensity, high-duration exercise causes more fatigue than the opposite (high-I, low-D), 2) More compounded lifts, like the deadlift, do not necessarily cause more CNS fatigue, and 3) CNS recovers quickly (10-20 min).
