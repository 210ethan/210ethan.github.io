Getting results with beginners is easy and should not be hero-fied. Instead prove you can work with experts who have to be milked for 1% of progress.

  Despite my best efforts, I occasionally lose the willpower battle or get tricked into visiting the site of a coach (the discipline varies). And they almost always have some type of success story page detailing exactly how they got this [overweight/never trained before/choose your disadvantage] person to do X in Y time. It's phrased in such a way that nobody else could have done
