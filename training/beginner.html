  Coaches take credit for whatever they can and we mistakenly reward them for all of it.

<h2 id="milking">Milking the Low-Hanging Fruit Stories to Cover Up Lack of Ability to Reach High-Hanging Fruit</h2>

<p>
  I rarely visit the testimonial section of websites. Too often they have some type of success story page detailing exactly how they got this [overweight/never trained before/choose your disadvantage] person to do X in Y time. It's phrased in such a way that nobody else could have done such a thing, that only they have the shortcut to get the magic pill to get a free lunch. They tout their program's effectiveness on getting clients [ripped/lean/toned/strong/durable], despite it being based on something that almost every other program is: progressive overload, basic periodization, CICO, and recovery schemes. Choose the principles based on the goals.

  There's no problem with beginners make progress. The problem is with these coaches being glamorized and rewarded for such easy-to-progress clients. Getting an overweight client to lose 10 kg is easy; getting a lean client down to 7% bodyfat while maintaining strength is difficult. Getting an untrained client to a bodyweight-added squat is easy; getting a hard-working client to a 140kg front squat is difficult. Getting a new runner to a sub 8:00 min mile is easy; getting a Jack Daniels follower to a sub 5:00 min mile is difficult.
</p>

<p>
  No one bats an eye at the first of those three, while the second feat turns heads. Yet we say someone is a good coach when they get anything up to or past the first achievements. This is wrong. Virtually anyone can lose 10 kg, squat their bodyweight on a barbell, and run faster than an 8:00 min mile. The formula is incredibly simple: find a well-reviewed program, fervently adhere to it for at least one year, and boom! the goal has been achieved. This logic cannot be extrapolated for loftier goals, for progress is logarithmic with both time and effort: intelligent programming must be implemented alongside hard work, patience, and consistency. It's here that the worthwhile coaches make themselves known. They have to know their client's training history and lifestyle and how they react to certain stimulus; they have to motivate (this should mostly be the client's burden, but <i>some</i> still falls on the coach); they have to instill trust in the coach-client relationship when things don't make sense or progress has stalled; they have to hold the client accountable (again, this is mostly on the client). These are not easy skills to attain or maintain. They require vast experience across a breadth of clients, empathy and sympathy, the ability to connect on a personal level, and a drive to see the client through to their goal despite an obstacle-ridden road. Coaches of those elite athletes are doing something right and I want to know what.

  The ability to change behavior for the long-term is an incredibly underrated skill that any coach—exercise-related or otherwise—can and should have. Most people who are deep in some hole have unproductive behaviors they've instilled over many years, behaviors that are ingrained in their life and habits and conscious and unconscious choices, behaviors that will require years of hard work to unlearn, behaviors that may be permanently installed.
</p>

<p>
  A good coach can help with all of that. There is nothing new under the sun—no revolutionary training methodology has been invented or discovered in the recent past—but crafting and feeding ideas and change in a palatable, personalized manner to a client may be the difference between them continuing to claw at the hole's walls and discovering the ladder that had been behind them the entire time. Books and courses are often one-size-fits-all for the good reason that most of the population will receive and respond to it well. The problem lies in neglecting the fact that some respond significantly differently to suggestions: what works for persons one through nine won't work for person 10. Person 10 keeps trying to fit that square peg through the round hole that Dr. Coach Guru &reg; swears is foolproof and works for everyone.

<p>
  I propose standards for coaching success. Anything that falls short is ignored and doesn't count towards testimonials—come back again when you're this tall to ride. Anything that surpasses the bare minimum is given a nod of approval—good job, but keep working. Anything that greatly exceeds expectations is celebrated and rewarded with attention—teach your methods to the world. The standards aren't rigid, but it will be obvious when it should be applauded. Clients know when they're getting the real deal.
</p>

<p>
  This raises the bar and forces wannabe coaches to improve their craft or get the fuck out, and I bet that exit line's gonna be long.
