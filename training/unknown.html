  Training with an unknown, but definite, finish.

<p>
  This past weekend (26 June 2021) I rode the <a href="races.html#tour_de_boerne_2021">Tour de Boerne</a>, a 61-mile road ride in the Texas Hill Country. As the name of the region implies, it was fairly hilly with a total elevation gain of 3,700 ft (which is laughable to some, but significant to someone whose average ride gain is 500 ft). Riding a fixie didn't help either.
</p>

<p>
  While the hills didn't help my legs or mind, the biggest problem I had was not knowing how far we were. I was blind on my bike, while my riding partner had his computer mounted on his stem, only calling out the remaining distance when I asked (once) or at a rest stop during conversation. This blindness led to me questioning my sanity of doing this on a fixie, to me telling myself there was only a few miles left until the pain was over.
</p>

<p>
  The questions began somewhere around mile 10 and only got more frequent as the race progressed and I got closer to the finish. At the same time, I considered the value of <i>not</i> knowing when something is going to end and ways to integrate the concept into one's training.

<h2 id="yet">Are We There Yet?</h2>

<p>
  Four types of numbers will be discussed, each with an example: known unknowns (of which there are two), unknown unknowns, and known knowns:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Known unknown 1 (KU1): The athlete knows the final number, but not their current position, due to losing count, not being able to count, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Known unknown 2 (KU2): The athlete knows their current position, but not the final number.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unknown unknown (UU): The athlete does not know the final number nor their current position.
  </li>
  <li>
    Known known (KK): The athletes knows the final number and their current position.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is, without a doubt, much easier to reach a known number than an unknown one. The athlete can focus on banging out the last few reps to reach the number, provided they know where they are. But what happens when you take the positional awareness away, leaving them in the dark and with 1-99% of the total effort remaining?
</p>

<h3 id="ku1">Known Unknown 1</h3>

<p>
  Example: Riding an X-mile bicycle race without any indication of distance from computer, signs, people, etc. The athlete has an extremely rough idea of where they're at, but the margin of error is high and dependent on the rider's experience.
</p>



<h3 id="ku2">Known Unknown 2</h3>

<p>
  Example: A coach tells the athlete to drop for push-ups and starts counting them off, giving no indication for when they'll be done.
</p>



<h3 id="uu">Unknown Unknown</h3>

<p>
  Strict UUs are virtually impossible, as the athlete always has <i>some</i> idea of the number, e.g., doing 200 pushups in a row or riding 500 miles will never be asked for. Wider ranges are better, though.
</p>

<p>
  Example: Racing the Four Horsemen.
</p>

<h3 id="kk">Known Known</h3>

<p>
  Example: Performing X sets of Y reps at a given intensity.
