<h2 id="poliquin_principles">Poliquin Principles</h2>

<p>
  <i>Poliquin Principels</i> is split into two parts: Section 1, "Defining the Poliquin Principles" (in regards to training methodology), and Section 2, "Applying the Poliquin Principles" (in regards to exercise selection and nutrition). The book is primarily geared towards bodybuilders, but strength athletes can heed its advice, too.
</p>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_reps">Reps</h3>

<blockquote>
  reps in the 1-to-5 range maximally increase strength with minimal gains in muscle mass, and reps in the 6-to-12 range maximally increase strength through muscle mass gains. [Higher rep ranges are neglected, but the table states that 9-12 are "best hypertrophy gains leading to increased maximal strength" and 13+ are "strength endurance gains and lower hypertrophy gains"]
</blockquote>

<p>
  But there is overlap in all of these. 1-5 reps can still pack on muscle (depending on other things) and 13+ can still provide strength (albeit way less efficiently).
</p>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_sets">Sets</h3>

<blockquote>
  At any given percentage of their maximum for one rep (1RM, or one repetition maximum), a woman can perform more reps than a man. Take the arm curl, for example. At 70 percent of her 1RM, we’ve found that a woman should be able to perform about 17 reps, whereas a man should be able to complete only about 12. Also, because there is an inverse relationship between sets and reps, this difference in neurological efficiency means women should do fewer sets at a given intensity.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The number of sets performed should be inversely proportionate to the size of the muscle mass trained. Small muscle groups recover more quickly than large muscle groups and, therefore, can handle more sets. Thus, you can perform more sets for the biceps than you can for the quadriceps.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  To maintain the quality of the training stimulus, you should perform no more than 30-36 sets per workout. We’ve seen better results when the total number of sets is kept between 20 and 25.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Muscles that are inherently fast-twitch respond best to more sets; muscles that are inherently slow-twitch respond best to fewer sets. Thus, you can perform more sets for the hamstrings (fast twitch) than for the soleus (slow twitch). Also, muscles not normally subjected to intense loading in daily activities, such as the neck flexors, respond better to fewer sets.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The neuromuscular basis of relative strength training involves performing brief but maximal voluntary contractions to improve the neural drive to the muscles. The great voluntary effort associated with such training recruits the highest-threshold motor units so as to make use of their greater strength and rate of force development. Near-maximal and maximal weights must be used.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_tempo">Tempo</h3>

<blockquote>
  When designing tempo prescriptions, there are some general guidelines you can follow that are backed by sport science. Slow-speed lifting brings about more metabolic adaptations than high-speed lifting. Training at faster speeds does not induce these changes. Also, performing slow reps builds the connection between the mind and the muscle, and they make a great finishing-off set.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  To develop maximum muscle mass, the optimal time a muscle should contract during a set should fall between 20 and 70 seconds. This range allows for a lot of variation, from sets consisting of 1 rep and lasting 70 seconds (brutal!) to sets involving 15 reps.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  In the bench press it has been shown that pausing 4 seconds on the chest will dissipate virtually all the plyometric effect elicited in a heavy lift. In fact, it’s estimated that during a bench press competition an extra 1-second delay for the judge’s clap could make a 5 percent difference in the amount of weight lifted! In contrast to powerlifters, bodybuilders want to emphasize longer pauses in their training because the muscles must contract harder when the plyometric effect is reduced.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  For the development of maximal strength, slow-speed training performed with heavy weights has a definite advantage over high-speed lifting. Slowing the movement increases both the duration of the stimulus and the levels of tension imposed on the muscle, factors that favor the development of strength and muscle mass. High-intensity, slow-speed training, which would be indicated by exercise prescriptions such as 4 x 4-6 on a 4161 tempo, will produce the following muscle-building effects: stimulation of the Type IIa fibers and increased muscle glycogen, CP, ATP, ADP, creatine, phosphorylase, PFK, and Krebs cycle enzyme activity – which collectively equate to more strength and muscle mass!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The key in power training for athletes is to keep the repetitions low (generally 1-5) to recruit the high-threshold motor units. Training with higher reps, even while concentrating on acceleration, would still access lower-threshold fibers.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_rest_intervals">Rest Intervals</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The length of your rest between sets affects several factors that are important in the adaptations brought on by your training. The rest interval accomplishes the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Regulates the partial, or nearly complete, restoration of the short-term-energy substrates necessary for maximal performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allows for the clearance of the metabolic waste accumulated in muscle tissue following intense muscular work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allows the central nervous system to recover.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slows down the elevated metabolic rate and heart rate caused by exercise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Affects the secretion of hormones that affect strength, fat loss, and muscle gains and to what magnitude.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Sports scientists recommend rest intervals of three to four minutes (and up to five minutes) for training with maximal loads: 1- to 5 reps maximums at 85 to 100 percent of max. That approach prevents early fatigue and enables you to make repeated efforts at high intensity.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  A guiding principle when developing strength is that the rest interval should be long enough to permit the nervous system to recover almost completely but not so long that you lose what’s called the post-tetanic potentiation effect (PTP). PTP is the phenomenon by which your contraction strength potential is increased for five to 10 minutes after a heavy set because of greater neural activation. ... The peak effect – that is, greatest potentiation – occurs about four minutes after a near-maximal contraction and then gradually wanes so that it’s gone by around the fifth minute. Consequently, when training for strength, you should rest about four minutes between sets of an exercise – that is, assuming we’re talking about a compound exercise. For isolation exercises, three minutes rest should suffices.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  An individual’s maximal strength has an impact on that phenomenon, however. If you can curl 155 pounds for reps, you may need four minutes rest; if you curl only 75 pounds for reps, three minutes rest should suffice.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    There are several other factors to consider when determining rest intervals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Training experience. The ability to tolerate short rest intervals with loads in the 60-80 percent range (6-20 reps) is a function of years of accumulated training. The lactate buildup resulting from this type of training is tolerated by only the well-conditioned bodybuilder. Therefore, rest intervals must be shortened for advanced trainees only, as for beginners lactate buildup will interfere with proper exercise performance. In fact, to prevent excessively high lactate buildup, it’s best to alternate upper- and lower-body exercises in your workouts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Muscle mass and strength levels. The bigger and stronger the trainee, the longer the rest interval should be. There appears to be a direct linear relationship between the length of the rest interval and the bodyweight of the trainee.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aerobic fitness. The more aerobically fit an athlete is, the shorter the rest interval should be – that’s the theory. The problem is that an aerobically-fit individual is normally weaker and usually possesses minimal muscle mass. It’s also common that these individuals tend to rush between heavy sets to maintain a high heart rate which decreases neural adaptation. Unfortunately, a high heart rate by itself does not lead to maximal gains in strength and mass.
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_frequency_duration_volume">Frequency, Duration and Volume</h3>

<p>
  Poliquin lays out eight (8) principles of training frequency:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Frequency is recovery dependent. Frequency is dependent upon your recovery ability at any given time. Failure to respect this rule may cause overtraining that could cause you to lose strength and muscle mass and come down with a variety of ailments that include lethargy and recurrent colds. Most bodybuilders train too frequently because they do not know how to assess their recovery ability or because they take too literally the slogan, “No pain, no gain.” However, provided you do an honest job and use the proper ratios of reps and sets, a frequency prescription of “twice per week, per muscle group” should work well. If you’re a more advanced bodybuilder, one workout every five days is probably the optimal training frequency.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is strength dependent. The weaker the trainee, the more frequently they can train. In cases of rehabilitation, such as post surgery, training frequencies of 4-6 times a week are well tolerated. Female trainees, because of their lower levels of maximal strength initially, need greater frequencies of training to maximize their training progress. As female trainees reach higher levels of strength, the differences in training-frequency requirements diminish appreciably. This effect usually occurs after two full years of training.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is muscle-group dependent. Large muscle groups recover slower than smaller muscle groups, and muscles with a high percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers recover slower than muscles with a high percentage of slow-twitch fibers. These facts have many practical applications. For example, while the soleus (predominately a slow-twitch, large-muscle group) may be trained two to three times a week, the hamstrings (predominantly a fast-twitch, large-muscle group) respond better to one or two training sessions per week.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is exercise dependent. Exercises that involve a small number of motor units, such as calf raises and wrist curls, can be performed more frequently than exercises that involve many motor units, such as squats. Exercises that involve a high percentage of motor units make greater demands on the central nervous system and, therefore, require longer recovery periods – it is not uncommon for powerlifters to rest ten days between intense deadlift sessions. Also, because multijoint exercises involve more muscles, they can create enough stimulus to ensure that strength and muscle mass are maintained in the secondary muscle groups.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is individualized. Frequency is dependent on work capacity. Some individuals can handle prodigious training volumes, while others can handle only minimal volumes. With our clients, we look at their training response in their workout diaries, and increase or decrease their training frequency based on how fast they progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is repetition-bracket dependent. The greater the intensity, the more rest is needed between workouts. Because intensity is partially determined by the number of reps performed per set, more rest days are needed between training sessions emphasizing low reps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is influenced by adrenal stress. All stressors have both general and specific effects on the body. If an athlete performs a set of squats, that activity has a specific stress on the muscle fibers, but it also produces general stress that triggers neural and hormonal responses. If the stress levels are too high, the body will not be able to adapt, and progress will cease or even regress. Aerobic work is one of the worst offenders in creating adrenal stress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frequency is dependent on nutritional intervention. Numerous studies have established that one of the keys to optimal recovery is post-workout nutrition, which requires carbohydrates to lower cortisol levels and increase muscle glycogen. If the nutrition is good, a higher frequency of training can be tolerated.
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Workouts exceeding the one-hour mark have been shown to be associated with rapidly decreasing androgen levels. This shift in androgens probably upsets the testosterone-cortisol ratio. Since this value is strongly correlated to strength gains, one may infer that training under depressed androgen levels is counterproductive, since the catabolic effects of the glucocorticoids would negate the anabolic effects of the androgens.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  One of the most important principles about training volume is this: Volume of training is always inversely related to intensity. In other words, you cannot work intensely and perform great amounts of work at the same time -- when the volume is high, the intensity is low and vice versa.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I would be interested to see the actual curve from above: percentage of 1RM on the x-axis and volume on the y-axis.
</p>

<blockquote>
  2 Percent Rule will apply to you. It states that every time you repeat a workout, you should be able to add 2 percent weight on the bar for the same number of reps or do an extra rep with the same weight. Thus, if you bench pressed 200 pounds for 8 reps in one workout, during the second workout you should be able to lift 204 pounds for 8 reps or lift 200 pounds for 9 reps. If you can accomplish this progression, or improve upon it, then your training frequency is appropriate.
</blockquote>

<p>
  As expected, the 2% rule regresses to the 1% rule and so on after an appreciable training history is developed.
</p>

<h3 id="poliquin_principles_selection_order">Exercise Selection and Exercise Order</h3>

<blockquote>
  The variation in the HGH response to these exercises is probably due to the differing mechanics of the two lifts. The larger hormonal responses associated with exercises involving large amounts of muscle mass – squats, for example – are partially responsible for indirect strength in untrained muscle groups, even the forearm extensors. So, how does this apply to training? When designing workouts for maximal weight loss, you want to get the greatest hormonal response. For that purpose choose exercises that are multijoint and that especially affect the lower-body muscles. To maintain a high level of intensity throughout such a workout, and because it takes longer to recover from lower-body exercises, alternate between upper- and lower-body exercises.
</blockquote>

<p>
  This can explain why people who focus primarily on squatting are so strong in other areas.
</p>

<blockquote>
  It is critical to train the antagonist of the targeted muscle group. ... weak antagonists send inhibitory signals to the brain that shut down force output in the agonists.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  improperly trained small stabilizing muscle groups will prevent the trainee from increasing the load on a compound exercise. This is because if the stabilizers perceive excessive tension on the prime movers, they will shut down neural output in the prime movers. The problem can be corrected by identifying the deficient area and training it with specific exercises at the end of the workout.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  We are proponents of thick-bar training for bodybuilders for two main reasons: First, it increases motor-unit activation. The more motor units you recruit and the higher their firing rate, the faster you gain in strength. ... Second, thick-bar work increases grip strength and forearm development because the fingers, wrists, thumbs and forearms are more challenged by the bigger diameter.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  As a general guideline, exercises should be changed every six workouts for optimal progress. Elite athletes need to change their exercises more frequently because their bodies adapt so quickly. Beginning and intermediate athletes may be able to use the same exercises for a month without experiencing a drop-off in progress. Another key factor that influences the rate of change is the nature of the exercise. The upper body needs more frequent changes in exercises than the lower body.
