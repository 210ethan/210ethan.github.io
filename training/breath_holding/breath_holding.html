<h1>Breath Holding (Apnea)</h1>

<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

<p>
  First, a short disclaimer on the dangers of breath holding: Breath holding, especially underwater, is quite dangerous. It is easy to blackout during breath holds, which can easily lead to drowning and ultimately death. If you do decide to do breath holds in water, follow two rules:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Never</b> work at or near a maximum hold time. Similar to strength training, it can actually be detrimental to improvement and dangerous to health.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Always</b> work with a partner who is <b>in the pool next to you</b>. Not on the side or in the bleachers. In the water.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Even then, underwater holds should be avoided and replaced by dry land work (still with a partner). <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+dies+holding+breath+underwater&oq=person+dies+breath+holding&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l4.4461j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Accidents</a> happen to both experienced swimmers and novices alike.
</p>

<p>
  While performing training tables, loss of motor control, blackout, and/or respiratory system damage can occur. Follow three rules to avoid these dangers:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Never</b> work at or near a maximum hold time. Similar to strength training, it can actually be detrimental to improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Always</b> work with a partner who is <b>in the pool next to you</b>. Not on the side or in the bleachers. In the water.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do not</b> practice more than one table per day or train two days in a row.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do not</b> perform more than 8 cycles in a single session.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Apnea is technically the act of not breathing, but applying it to sport, apnea is the practice of holding one's breath. There are arguably two disciplines of sport apnea: static (staying still) and dynamic (moving). Since the primary application of apnea is freediving, the two terms will be used interchangeably, except in certain instances.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>
  Apnea has been in practice for hundreds of years. With no type of SCUBA technology available (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/612512.The_Silent_World?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=kzRd0BsSbi&rank=2"><i>The Silent World</i></a> details the advent of SCUBA technology, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3198313093">review here</a>), people had to resort to holding their breaths to reach the bottom of the body of water, whether it be to hunt or scavenge from a shipwreck.
</p>

<p>
  In 1992, the International Association for the Development of Apnea (AIDA (acronym based on French spelling)) was formed in France to promote the sport of apnea, both recreationally and competitively. Another organization, the World Underwater Organization (CMAS (acronym based on French spelling)), encompasses all underwater training, where freediving is a small subset of the whole.
</p>

<p>
  The AIDA recognized disciplines are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>No Limit (NLT)</b>: The diver descends with a weight and ascends however they want. Measured by depth. Not sanctioned by AIDA.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Variable Weight (VWT)</b>: The diver descends with a weight and ascends without assistance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Constant Weight (CWT)</b>: The diver descends and ascends using fins and/or arms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Constant Weight Without Fins (CNF)</b>: Same as CWT, just without fins.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Free Immersion (FIM)</b>: The diver descends and ascends using the rope.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dynamic With Fins (DYN)</b>: The diver uses fins to travel the farthest horizontal distance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dynamic Without Fins (DNF)</b>: Same as DYN, just without fins.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Static Apnea (STA)</b>: The diver holds their breath for as long as possible with their nose and mouth are submerged in water.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The paper <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/EP086269"><i>Physiology of static breath holding in elite apneists</i></a> is one of the most comprehensive studies done on the physiology of static apnea. This paper should be read to best understand the science and physiology behind apnea.
</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<p>
  Breath hold time is a function of two characteristics:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The body's ability to handle and conserve oxygen. The higher the heart rate, the more oxygen will be used, and the diver will need to breath sooner than his counterpart with a slower heart rate. Moving (read: using muscles) requires oxygen, thus increasing heart rate and decreasing hold time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lung volume, which is proportional to oxygen storage capacity.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The mammalian diving response/reflex (MDR) has a large effect on the hold time. When submerged in water, the body will optimize its oxygen use by directing it to the heart, brain, and other tissues requiring oxygen, rather than "wasting" the precious gas on tissue that doesn't need it for the time being.
</p>

<p>
  Once the water is detected by the central nervous system (CNS) (generally via the nose), both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction">peripheral vasoconstriction</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia">bradycardia</a> occur, narrowing the blood vessels within the limbs and slowing the heart rate, respectively. Blood pressure is <a href="https://www.cvpharmacology.com/clinical%20topics/hypertension">calculated</a> by multiplying the cardiac output and vascular resistance, so when output decreases (bradycardia) and resistance increases (vasoconstriction), blood pressure will remain approximately constant, preventing hypertension.
</p>

<p>
  Heart rate <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1992.tb137408.x">correlates directly</a> with facial temperature.
</p>

<p>
  Peripheral vasoconstriction and bradycardia still occur without submersion into water (dry apnea), but to a lesser degree.
</p>

<h3 id="adaptations">Adaptations</h3>

<p>
  All that information is nice, but how does one actually get better at holding their breath? What physical adaptations take place within the body to allow for longer hold times?
</p>

<p>
  Bain et al. 2018 provides an excellent figure (see below) that shows the pathways towards longer breath holds.
</p>

<p>
  The maximum hold procedure will be performed lying down and is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Three 1:00 min holds with 1 full inhalation/exhalation cycle and 2:00 min recovery between holds.
  </li>
  <li>
    One maximum hold with 1 full inhalation/exhalation cycle.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This procedure was also conducted on a trained runner who recently ran a 1:20:00 hr half-marathon (21.1 km, 13.1 mi) and 5:20 min 1600 m. He had no prior breath holding experience. His maximum hold was 2:30 min.
</p>

<p>
  The following CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> training tables will be recalculated after the t<sub>0</sub> + 30/60/90 day retests.
</p>

<h4 id="training">Training</h3>

<p>
  The training to improve the maximum hold will consist of two sessions per week: one CO<sub>2</sub> session and one O<sub>2</sub> session. Each session's individual hold times will be increased by 0:03 min (3 sec) on a weekly basis.
</p>

<p>
  The CO<sub>2</sub> session holds are constant at 50% of maximum breath hold with decreasing recovery intervals. This session is meant to improve the body's handling of CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation. As the recovery period decreases, excess CO<sub>2</sub> will still be present. There are two types of progressions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Decrease recovery periods and maintain hold time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase hold time and maintain recovery periods.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The O<sub>2</sub> session holds begin at 40% of maximum breath hold and end at 75% with constant recovery times of 2:00 min. There is only one type of progression:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Increase hold time and maintain recovery periods. (Decreasing recovery periods borders on CO<sub>2</sub> training. The 2:00 min rest period is meant to ensure full recovery between sets.)

  It is said that strength can be maintained by one training session per week. What about breath holding?
</p>

<p>
  In order to document this, after the 90 days are complete, abbreviated CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sessions will be performed once per week with the following structure:

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>
  The obvious frontrunner, freediving is the reason most people practice breath holding. With longer holds, you can stay under for longer, go farther, and be more comfortable. Most explorations are limited by the breath and ability to withstand pressure (if takes 45 sec to get to the shipwreck, but the diver's maximum hold is 1:30 min, good luck exploring it (but maybe they can get a quick photo for the 'gram)).
</p>

<img src="media/shipwreck.png" alt="shipwreck" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Steering the Flying Dutchman</figcaption>

<p>
  With freediving, coral reefs, shipwrecks, pools, and other attractions involving water are much more accessible. Of course, static apnea is only somewhat applicable—freediving needs freediving training, i.e., dynamic wet apnea.
