<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
  First, a short disclaimer on the dangers of breath holding: Breath holding, especially underwater, is quite dangerous. It is easy to blackout during breath holds, which can easily lead to drowning and ultimately death. If you do decide to do breath holds in water, follow two rules:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Never</b> work at or near a maximum hold time. Similar to strength training, it can actually be detrimental to improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Always</b> work with a partner who is <b>in the pool next to you</b>. Not on the side or in the bleachers. In the water.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Even then, underwater holds should be avoided and replaced by dry land work (still with a partner). <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=man+dies+holding+breath+underwater&oq=person+dies+breath+holding&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l4.4461j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Accidents</a> happen to both experienced swimmers and novices alike.
</p>

<p>
  While performing training tables, loss of motor control, blackout, and/or respiratory system damage can occur. Follow three rules to avoid these dangers:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Never</b> work at or near a maximum hold time. Similar to strength training, it can actually be detrimental to improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Always</b> work with a partner who is <b>in the pool next to you</b>. Not on the side or in the bleachers. In the water.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do not</b> practice more than one table per day or train two days in a row.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do not</b> perform more than 8 cycles in a single session.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>
  First, a baseline maximum (not 100%) breath hold will be taken. The procedure will be performed lying down and is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Three 1:00 min holds with 2 full inhalation/exhalation cycles and 2:00 min recovery between holds.
  </li>
  <li>
    One maximum hold with 2 full inhalation/exhalation cycles.
  </li>
</ul>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    Maximum holds
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Date
    </th>
    <th>
      Time (min)
    </th>
    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> (19 April 2020)</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> + 30 days</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> + 60 days</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> + 90 days</td><td></td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The following CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> training tables will be recalculated after the t<sub>0</sub> + 30/60/90 day retests.
</p>

<h4 id="training">Training</h3>

<p>
  The training to improve the maximum hold will consist of two sessions per week: one CO<sub>2</sub> session and one O<sub>2</sub> session.
</p>

<p>
  The CO<sub>2</sub> session holds are constant at 50% of maximum breath hold with decreasing recovery intervals. This session is meant to improve the body's handling of CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation. As the recovery period decreases, excess CO<sub>2</sub> will still be present. There are two types of progressions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Decrease recovery periods and maintain hold time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase hold time and maintain recovery periods.
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    CO<sub>2</sub> table
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Hold (%)
    </th>
    <th>
      Recovery (min)

    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>1:45</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>1:30</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>1:15</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>1:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>0:45</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>0:30</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>0:15</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The O<sub>2</sub> session holds begin at 40% of maximum breath hold and end at 75% with constant recovery times of 2:00 min. There is only one type of progression:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Increase hold time and maintain recovery periods.
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    O<sub>2</sub> table

    <tr align="middle"><td>40</td><td>2:00</td></tr>

    <tr align="middle"><td>60</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>65</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>70</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>75</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>
  It is said that strength can be maintained by one training session per week. What about breath holding?
</p>

<p>
  In order to document this, after the 90 days are complete, abbreviated CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sessions will be performed once per week with the following structure:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    CO<sub>2</sub> maintenance table
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Hold (%)
    </th>
    <th>
      Recovery (min)
    </th>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>1:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>0:45</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>0:30</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    O<sub>2</sub> maintenance table
  </caption>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Hold (%)
    </th>
    <th>
      Recovery (min)
    </th>
    <tr align="middle"><td>50</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>60</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>70</td><td>2:00</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>80</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Maximum breath hold will then be retested at 30, 60, and 90 days to check for progression, regression, or stagnation. 
</p>

<table align="center">

    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> (17 August 2020)</td><td></td></tr>

    <tr align="middle"><td>t<sub>0</sub> + 60 days</td><td></td></tr>
  </tr>

<h3 id="freediving">Freediving</h3>

<p>
  The obvious frontrunner, freediving is the reason most people practice breath holding. With longer holds, you can stay under for longer, go farther, and be more comfortable. Most explorations are limited by the breath and ability to withstand pressure (if takes 45 sec to get to the shipwreck, but the diver's maximum hold is 1:30 min, good luck exploring it (but maybe they can get a quick photo for the 'gram)).
</p>

<p>
  With freediving, coral reefs, shipwrecks, pools, and other attractions-involving-water are much more accessible. Of course, static apnea is only somewhat applicable—freediving needs freediving training, i.e., dynamic apnea.
