A deeply moving story about a mentally retarded adult's journey from retardation to genius and back, complete with experiences of love, realizations, learning, successes, and failures. The writing is masterfulâ€”Keyes is able to gradually display Charlie's ever-increasing intelligence just through writing. He begins learning punctuation, remembers the correct spelling of words, and makes connections with the real world.

I especially liked the adherence to the hypothesis: "artificially-induced intelligence deteriorates at a rate of time directly proportional to the quantity of the increase". In laymen terms, if you gain a significant amount of intelligence from the surgery, expect to lose it quickly when you start to lose it. Charlie is sadly proven correct: while his initial intelligence gain was slow, his decline was quick, taking from mid-September to mid-November, peak to original standing.
