  There's a reason why most well-regarded training programs focus on a few core exercises or sessions. It's the Pareto principle: a minority of the exercises will provide a majority of the rewards. Furthermore, they're uni-directionally transferrable. I'm able to row 100 lb dumbbells with ease despite only training weighted chins and single-leg RDLs. The inverse is not necessarily true. I doubt someone who focuses on rowing 100s without training chins can chin as much as I can.

  That's why it saddens me when I see people on programs that vary regularly vary exercises.
