  There's a reason why most well-regarded training programs focus on a few primary exercises or sessions. It's the Pareto principle: a minority of the exercises will provide a majority of the rewards. Furthermore, they're uni-directionally transferrable. I'm able to row 100 lb dumbbells with ease despite only training weighted chins and single-leg RDLs. The inverse is not necessarily true.

  That's why it saddens me when I see people on programs that regularly vary exercises. And again, that's why those well-regarded programs are well-regarded. They work!
