<p>
  Note that this tutorial's videos were filmed after about one year of not training the skill. This shows two things:

<ol>
  <li>
    The <a href="#combinations">suggested combinations</a> are not shown, as I can't do them smoothly anymore.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you train this skill often and long enough, you will always be able to do it.

</ol>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  The OAEL requires basic strength and balance skills, which can be satisified by the following prerequisites:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gmb.io/elbow-lever/">Two-arm elbow lever</a>: This should be an effortless hold for both strength and balance. Breathing should be easy.
  </li>
  <li>
    20 pushups: Basic pushing strength.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="../wrist_ankle_strength/wrist_ankle_strength.html#wrists">Wrist strength</a>: All of your bodyweight is going onto one hand/wrist, so it needs to be strong enough to support that.
  </li>
  <li>
    Handstand (recommended): OAEL uses the wrists and <a href="http://chrissalvato.com/2013/02/what-is-the-cambered-hand-technique/">cambered hand technique</a> to adjust balance. This is also used in HS.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>

<h3 id="grip">Grip</h3>

<p>
  I've found it easiest to use the corner of a ledge (preferable) or ledge to train OAEL. It's easier to grasp and correct balance. The floor gives you less grip and less correction abilities. However, practicing on the floor will make you better on ledges/other surfaces, but not vice versa.

<h3 id="stabbing">Stabbing</h3>

<p>
  Where your elbow "stabs" is one of the most important parts of the OAEL. Too close to your abs and it's awkward, too far and you're close to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgBUpqhueRA">queda de rins</a> due to the torso rotation required for balance.

<h3 id="adjustments">Adjustments</h3>

<p>
  Balancing is achieved through the adjustment of body parts. The wrist, legs, and non-working arm all contribute to the equilibrium of weight that balance requires. At first the tendency will be to move your arms and legs almost to the point of flailing, but once you get it under control the movements are minimal and most of the balance comes from the wrist. This is why developing a handstand prior to training this is so helpful—the ability to adjust balance using the wrists is crucial.
</p>

<h2 id="progressions">Progressions</h2>

<p>
  To move on from a progression, you should achieve 3-5x30s in a single session with an easy to moderate effort.
</p>

<h3 id="weight_shifts">Weight Shifts</h3>

<p>
  While in normal straddle EL, slowly shift weight to one side. Eventually no weight will be resting on the other arm and it will be free to lift. Note the entire body—torso and legs—are shifting, rather than just one. While the video's angle is poor, the left arm is obviously out from under the torso where it was initially stabbing.
</p>

<h3 id="finger_assist">Finger Assist</h3>

<p>
  Once the non-working arm isn't supporting weight, you can use your fingers to assist in balancing. The progression goes as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    All five fingers
  </li>
  <li>
    Four fingers (no pinky)
  </li>
  <li>
    Three fingers (no pinky or ring)
  </li>
  <li>
    Two fingers (only index and thumb)
  </li>
  <li>
    One finger (only index)
  </li>
  <li>
    One finger (only ring)
  </li>
  <li>
    One finger (only pinky)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The fingers should focus on helping balance, <i>not</i> supporting weight. (This same principle applies to any one-arm balance exercise, like HS or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9O5wZnQfA">air baby</a>.) I prefer to keep the arm out wide, as there is less ability to support weight.
</p>

<h3 id="unassisted_holds">Unassisted Holds</h3>

<p>
  After you can correctly hold the one finger (only pinky) progression for 3-5x30s, unassisted holds are within reach. Get into the same position as with the pinky assist, but lift your pinky slightly off the floor. If you feel yourself losing balance you can touch with the pinky to save the hold.
</p>

<p>
  There are three progressions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Straddle: Legs full straddle and arm out providing a counterbalance
  </li>
  <li>
    Full: Legs together in full-lay and arm out providing a counterbalance
  </li>
  <li>
    Full with no arm: Legs together in full-lay and arm at side
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="advanced_progressions">Advanced Progressions</h3>

<h4 id="combinations">Combinations</h4>

<p>
  Combinations can be used after the unassisted holds have been mastered. These are more difficult because the weight is constantly moving, causing constant rebalancing in many directions.
</p>

<p>
  Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Straddle &#8594; half-lay straddle &#8594; half-lay &#8594; full-lay
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotations: Pivot on the hand to rotate 90-120° and back. Can also
  </li>
  <li>
    Straddle scissors: Quickly alternate between straddle and full
  </li>
  <li>
    Kicks: Half-lay to full-lay, either straddle or full
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h4>

<p>
  OAEL can be done while spinning around the working arm's axis:
</p>

<p>
  OAEL can be entered from OAHS and vice versa:

<h2 id="training_plan">Training Plan</h2>

<p>
  With skills involving balance, practicing as <i>frequently</i> as possible and with the best form is key. Progress will be significantly greater if you practice 5 day/week for 30 min than 1 day/week for 150 min.
</p>

<p>
  I suggest doing these in a standalone session. Practicing after a strength session may cause poor form due to muscle fatigue and ingrain incorrect movement patterns. See below for specific levels of practice. All sessions should begin with a wrist warm-up.
