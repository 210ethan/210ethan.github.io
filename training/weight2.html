<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<p>
  This approach has a few considerations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Grocery shopping is done at the minimum frequency that still allows "enough" food to be eaten (trainees should know what this is). This is likely 1-2 times per week, depending on their needs and shopping inconvience methods listed below.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eating out must be kept to a minimum. When going out, the trainee should bring their personal miniature utensils.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initial cost is high, but the investment is recouped quickly through food savings.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>
  The inconvenience approach is two-fold, focusing on shopping and meal preparation.
</p>

<h3 id="shopping">Shopping</h3>

<p>
  For shopping, only miniature carts or shopping bags can be used. This means if it doesn't fit there, it can't be bought. And yes, this may require personally purchasing the shopping cart (or similar) and hauling it to and from the store. The purpose is to physically limit the amount of groceries that can be bought at one time by physically limiting shopping space. The trainee can decide whether to allow items to go over the brim of the cart or bags or if it must be under the top-most threshold.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose here is to physically limit the number of calories that can be bought while shopping. Sure, the cart can be loaded up with calorically-dense foods, but these are often at odds with the health-conscious food choices one should be making while trying to lose weight. So while muffins can be added, they are probably added after the main meal ingredients. Further, most less-healthy foods' packaging will waste valuable caloric real estate (see the joke about air bags being partially filled with chips), while healthy foods are often just the foods themselves with minimal or no packaging. To get more food, embrace real and avoid fake.

<h3 id="preparation">Meal Preparation</h3>

<p>
  For preparing meals, only miniature cookware, dishware, and utensils can be used. This three-pronged approach offers three distinct advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cookware: Trainees cannot accidentally cook more than they need, only intentionally. The long cooking times dissaude trainees from multiple rounds, resulting in less food being eaten as a result of cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dishware: The classic trick for making meals look bigger applies here [FINISH]
  </li>
  <li>
    Utensils: Trainees' food throughput is limited by the utensil not being able to do more. This gives more time for the satiety signal to be recognized.
  </li>
</ul>
