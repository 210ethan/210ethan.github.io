<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
  Two disclaimers before starting:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    I haven't lost weight in years. I'm happy with my weight and physique, and unless my training goals change, I'll maintain this for years to come.
  </li>
  <li>
    I haven't coached anyone to significant weight loss. This is due to lack of client availability.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="volume">Volume Eating</h2>

<p>
  Volume eating is the practice of eating lots of food that are not calorically dense. A visual can be found on the NHS' <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/what-does-100-calories-look-like/">What does 100 calories look like?</a>.
</p>

<p>
  One issue many have with losing weight is the constant uncomfortable feeling of hunger.
