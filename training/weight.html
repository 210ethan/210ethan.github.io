<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<p>
  I approach weight loss using a two-pronged solution:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Behavior: Individuals can act on specific behaviors to make weight loss easier
  </li>
  <li>
    Environment: Individuals cultivate a certain environment that makes aforementioned behaviors easy
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the environment is not right, following through on the behaviors will be much more difficult. If the behaviors can't be followed in any case, then the environment doesn't matter. Weight loss is a two-legged stool that can topple at any moment if attention wanes or discipline wavers.
</p>

<p>
  The following sections are split up into behaviors and environmental factors for clarity, but both can be progressed simultaneously.
</p>

<h2 id="behaviors">Behaviors</h2>

<h3 id="relationship">Relationship with Food</h3>

<p>
  Creating and maintaining a healthy relationship with food is critical to successful weight loss. Too many people use food as a reward for a job well done or a coping mechanism for negative emotions; others abstain from unhealthy foods for a few weeks and then binge eat when they can't take it anymore.
</p>

<p>
  Some basic suggestions on improving one's relationship with food (this is probably better left to a professional, but whatever):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Minimize rewards being food-based, especially when alone. Going out with friends or family to celebrate is fine, but eating a tub of ice cream for exercising for 30 min is not.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find other ways to deal with negative emotion. Exercise, meditation, socialization, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Practice moderation of certain unhealthy foods that are tempting. I'm not a fan of <a href="../thoughts/moderation.html">moderation</a>, but it works for some.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use willpower to stop eating before feeling full.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I'd argue this is one of the most important factors in weight loss.
</p>

<h3 id="minimal">Minimal Meals</h3>

<p>
  I won't get into the (pseudo)science of fasting, but rather focus on the benefits it provides portion-wise. Practicing an eight-hour feed window means all calories have to be consumed within that time, leading to larger portions than if the feed window was as long as the awake window. The smaller the feed window, the larger the portions.
</p>

<p>
  The extreme position (outside of truly extended fasting) is OMAD, or one meal a day.
</p>

<p>
  I personally found great value out of this method. I enjoy eating a lot in a single sitting and my schedule was such that I didn't have a convenient opportunity to eat until a few hours before bedtime, so I was able to stuff my face after a long day. The hunger becomes bearable, but energy deteriorates steadily throughout the day.
</p>

<h3 id="volume">Volume Eating</h3>

<p>
  Volume eating is the practice of eating lots of food that are not calorically dense. A visual can be found on the NHS' <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/what-does-100-calories-look-like/">What does 100 calories look like?</a>. Eating lots of food with a low caloric density allows satiety to be achieved without the calories that generally come with it.
</p>

<p>
  Example foods are primary vegetables, but some fruits are included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Vegetables:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spinach
      </li>
      <li>
        Kale
      </li>
      <li>
        Squash
      </li>
      <li>
        Zucchini
      </li>
      <li>
        Asparagus
      </li>
      <li>
        Mushrooms
      </li>
      <li>
        Broccoli
      </li>
      <li>
        Carrots
      </li>
      <li>
        Brussel sprouts
      </li>
      <li>
        Cauliflower
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fruits:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bananas (kind of)
      </li>
      <li>
        Blueberries
      </li>
      <li>
        Strawberries
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Meats: Lean cuts of meat are the least calorie dense.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ham
      </li>
      <li>
        Turkey
      </li>
      <li>
        Chicken
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Drinks:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Water
      </li>
      <li>
        Carbonated water: The carbonation fills up the stomach much faster than regular water
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Volume eating meals are straightforward: combine any of the foods above and eat until full. Simply search for "volume eating meals" to find examples.
</p>

<h3 id="suppressants">Appetite Suppressants</h3>

<p>
  There are appetite suppressant medications available, but there are more "natural" options available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>
