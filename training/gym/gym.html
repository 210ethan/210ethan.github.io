<h1 id="gym">Home Gym: Setup and Equipment</h1>

<p>
  Why you should get a home gym, how to set it up, and equipment suggestions. (Some of this text is copied from the Home Gym section of my <a href="../../miscellaneous/improvements/improvements.html#home_gym">Life Improvements</a> post.)
</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>
  A personal home gym poses a few distinct advantages compared to the stereotypical commercial gym.
</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>
  Cost of a home gym depends heavily on a few things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Quality and brand of equipment: <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/">Rogue Fitness</a> equipment will cost a lot more than some Walmart-brand squat rack or barbell, but quality is vastly superior.
  </li>
  <li>
    Breadth of equipment: Do you want a rowing machine? What about a SkiErg? A few kettlebells? Grippers? While these are not truly necessary for "fitness", they are helpful, albeit expensive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used vs. new: Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace can offer great deals on used equipment, but may sacrifice quality.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Overall, my total amount spent on home gym equipment is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Powerlifting: (Squat rack, adjustable bench, 45 lb barbell, 255 lb of weights (2x45, 2x35, 2x25, 2x10, 4x5, 2x2.5)), 2x45 plates, belt
  </li>
  <li>
    Kettlebells: 20, 30, 53, 70 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Dumbbells: 2x20, 2x15, 2x12, 2x10, 2x8, 2x5, 2x3 lb
  </li>
  <li>
    Calisthenics: Dip/pull-up tower, dip belt, gymnastics rings, <a href="https://chrispconstantlyvaried.blogspot.com/2011/09/crossfit-home-gym-how-to-hang-gymnastic.html?m=1">ceiling mount</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Grip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ur4dQD-MY">Pinch block</a>, <a href="http://www.dieselcrew.com/how-to-make-rotating-thick-grips/">thick grips</a>, <a href="https://www.ironmind.com/product-info/grip-strength-training-tools/captains-of-crush-grippers/">grippers</a> (x2)
  </li>
  <li>
    Conditioning: <a href="https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/model-d">Concept2 rower</a>, <a href="https://bikehistory.org/bikes/exerciser/">Schwinn Air-Dyne Ergometer</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Cost per item ($):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    (150), 60, 60
  </li>
  <li>
    10, 15, 100, 140
  </li>
  <li>
    46, 34, 28, 24, 18, 12, 8
  </li>
  <li>
    150, 35, 60, 30
  </li>
  <li>
    20, 20, (25, 25)
  </li>
  <li>
    1100, 150
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Total cost: $2320 (brief notes below)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Almost half of the total cost comes from the Concept2 alone.
  </li>
  <li>
    I got the powerlifting equipment for an unheard of price back in 2010.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The average commercial gym costs "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/26663228">between $40 and $50 a month</a>" = $480-600 per year = $540 average. The lowest price I've seen is <a href="https://www.planetfitness.com/gym-memberships">Planet Fitness</a> at $10/month = $120/year. Depending on the membership cost, the breakeven point is:
</p>

\[\text{breakeven_avg} = \frac{$2320}{$540\text{/yr}} = 4.30 \, \text{yr}\]

\[\text{breakeven_cheap} = \frac{$2320}{$120\text{/yr}} = 19.33 \, \text{yr}\]

<h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>

<p>
  No more driving to the gym or making sure to go during business hours. Simply go to the home gym in 10 seconds at any time. Driving and time saved:
</p>

\[\text{miles_saved} = (2-4) \, \text{mi/drive} \times (3-5) \, \text{drive/wk} \times 50 \, \text{wk/yr} = (300-2000) \, \text{mi/yr}\]

\[\text{gas_money_saved} = (300-2000) \, \text{mi/yr} \times \frac{1}{20} \, \text{gal/mi} \times $2.50/\text{gal} = $(40 - 250)/\text{yr}\]

\[\text{time_saved} = (10-30) \, \text{min/drive} \times (3-5) \, \text{drive/wk} \times 50 \, \text{wk/yr} = (25-125) \, \text{hr/yr}\]

<h3 id="style">Style</h3>

<p>
  No judgment, no one to tell you you're being too loud or annoying (except maybe the police and neighbors), wear (or not wear) whatever you want.
</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>

<p>
  Equipment availability is completely up to you. No waiting for someone to finish up their sets, nor are you limited by lack of options (except financially). Choose what equipment to outfit your home gym with.
</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>
  My focus is on strength and conditioning (S&C), so the equipment listed reflects that. Optional equipment is followed by "(1)", "(2)", or "(3)"â€”the higher the number, the more optional and less helpful towards general S&C goals. "Necessary" equipment (deemed so by me) has nothing following it. As seen, the only necessary equipment is a barbell, weight plates, and squat rack.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Strength:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Bars: Olympic barbell, trap/hex bar (1)
    </li>
    <li>
      Weights plates (lb/kg): 2-4x45/20, 2x35/15, 2-4x25/10, 2-4x10/5, 2-4x5/2.5, 2-4x2.5/1.25
    </li>
    <li>
      Dumbbells (lb/kg, 1-3 depending on strength): 2x(choose appropriate weight depending on strength)
    </li>
    <li>
      Kettlebells (lb/kg, 1-3 depending on strength): 1x106/48, 1x70/32, 1x53/24, 1x35/16
    </li>
    <li>
      Squat rack
    </li>
    <li>
      Lifting accessories: Belt (1), lifting shoes (2), wrist straps (3)
    </li>
    <li>
      Calisthenics: Pull-up bar (1), gymnastics rings (1), dip belt (1),
    </li>
    <li>
      Grip: grippers (1), fat grips (handles or attachments) (2), pinch block (3)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Conditioning:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Concept2 rower (1)
    </li>
    <li>
      Schwinn AirDyne/Assault Air Bike/Rogue Echo/BikeErg (1)
    </li>
    <li>
      SkiErg (2)
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  This section will focus on minimizing the footprint of the gym and getting the most bang-for-buck space-wise. Before that, the necessary equipment is listed to give an idea of the gym space itself.

  My focus is on strength and conditioning, so the equipment listed reflects that.
