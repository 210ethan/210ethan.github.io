<ul>
  <li>
    Info: 07 May 2021, 9:35pm start time, off Mission Road in San Antonio, Texas
  </li>
  <li>
    Place: No idea, guessing around 15/25 (guessing on both numbers)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  First ever bike race! Got in around 9:10pm after struggling to find parking, put my bike together, then stood around talking to a friend while waiting for the women's fixed division to finish up. No stretching, no warm-up, just a six-hour drive to get there. Riders lined up, the organizer took roll, and the race was ready to start in 3..2..1..
</p>

<p>
  Riders up front immediately took off and were instantly in their own race while the rest of us mere mortals were out of the saddle trying to establish a decent position. I ended up in penultimate on the first straight away, but made up ground by the end of the first lap. A nasty headwind was working against us on the middle half of the course, so I proposed helping each other out to another rider, which he graciously accepted. We alternated straights for laps 2-4 (ish, I can't remember exactly) until he dropped (I eventually saw him walking his bike, so I assume he had a mechanical failure). The rest of the race I was in no man's land. The closest rider behind me was quite a ways back, while the one in front had about 10 seconds on me&mdash;a not-insignificant distance.
</p>

<p>
  I was slowly gaining on the rider in front of me, but just couldn't completely close the gap. I glanced behind me and noticed quite a few headlights getting closer and closer...definitely the peloton about to lap me! I pushed through the rest of lap 8 and was passed 30 seconds into lap 9, forcing me to drop out per race rules.
</p>

<p>
  A few thoughts/things to work on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I need to switch to clipless shoes/pedals on the fixie. I'll install some this weekend and work on getting shoes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Working hard to get in someone's draft to avoid wind is much easier than continuing to fight the wind throughout the entire race.
  </li>
  <li>
    Corners are not my strong suit. I found myself slowing down significantly and losing momentum on the course's two tight turns. This is something I need to work on.
  </li>
</ul>
