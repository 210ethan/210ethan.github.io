<h2 id="tour_de_boerne_2021">Tour de Boerne - 26 June 2021</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info: 26 June 2021, started on Don Strange Ranch
  </li>
  <li>
    Route: 61.38 mi, 3,700 ft elevation gain, 3:47:50 moving time, 16.2 mph average (all according to Strava)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bike: 6KU Fixie
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Race (more of a ride than race) started around 7:15am. I was riding my 6KU Fixie (48/16) My friend (let's call him Alex) and I got out fairly fast, passing quite a few people in the first 5 miles and averaging close to 22 mph on a relatively flat course. And then the hills began. The first one was a bit of a grinder to get up, and the subsequent downhill was unenjoyable due to my having to constantly pedal. My legs were having a tough time, making me unsure if this was just them being cold (I've found my legs take around 45-60 min to warm up) or already failing.
</p>

<p>
  Around the 22 mile mark was the crux of the ride: a 400-ft-tall hill spanning what felt like miles, but whose actual distance I don't know. It just kept going and going, twisting and turning through the Texas hills but never actually flattening. I was out of the saddle the entire time, but not pushing like my other hillsâ€”it was just too long!
</p>

<p>
  A Willie Nelson cutout greeted us at the 27 mile mark in Luckenbach, Texas, where we refilled our bottles with Gatorade and water and ate a snack.
</p>

<p>
  Miles 27-late-30s were headwind hell. It never stopped and never shifted. Just a never-ending supply of air gushing directly at us for 10+ miles, forcing us to switch off who was leading and who was drafting. Hills came included, mostly rollers but a few punchy ones here and there.
</p>

<p>
  Mile 45-ish was our final major rest station. The remaining 16 miles were not to be taken lightly. It started off with a steep hill climb that had a few people walking their bikes, then mostly flat until the remaining 4 miles, where the hills returned. At that point they all felt miles long and deathly steep. The cherry on top was descending what we thought was the final climb, only to turn the corner and see what turned out to be the actual final one looming in the distance.
</p>

<p>
  Post-race refreshments included BBQ and two Shiner Bocks.
</p>

<p>
  Thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Riding a fixie was pretty fun, but also sucked. A lot. I will continue to do it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The importance of mental training proves itself yet again.
  </li>

<h2 id="first_friday_crit_may_2021">First Friday Crit - 07 May 2021</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info: 07 May 2021, 9:35pm start time, off Mission Road in San Antonio, Texas
  </li>
  <li>
    Place: No idea, guessing around 15/25 (guessing on both numbers)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bike: 6KU Fixie
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  First ever bike race! Got in around 9:10pm after struggling to find parking, put my bike together, then stood around talking to a friend while waiting for the women's fixed division to finish up. No stretching, no warm-up, just a six-hour drive to get there. Riders lined up, the organizer took roll, and the race was ready to start in 3..2..1..
</p>

<p>
  Riders up front immediately took off and were instantly in their own race while the rest of us mere mortals were out of the saddle trying to establish a decent position. I ended up in penultimate on the first straight away, but made up ground by the end of the first lap. A nasty headwind was working against us on the middle half of the course, so I proposed helping each other out to another rider, which he graciously accepted. We alternated straights for laps 2-4 (ish, I can't remember exactly) until he dropped (I eventually saw him walking his bike, so I assume he had a mechanical failure). The rest of the race I was in no man's land. The closest rider behind me was quite a ways back, while the one in front had about 10 seconds on me&mdash;a not-insignificant distance.
</p>

<p>
  I was slowly gaining on the rider in front of me, but just couldn't completely close the gap. I glanced behind me and noticed quite a few headlights getting closer and closer...definitely the peloton about to lap me! I pushed through the rest of lap 8 and was passed 30 seconds into lap 9, forcing me to drop out per race rules.
</p>

<p>
  A few thoughts/things to work on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I need to switch to clipless shoes/pedals on the fixie. I'll install some this weekend and work on getting shoes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Working hard to get in someone's draft to avoid wind is much easier than continuing to fight the wind throughout the entire race.
  </li>
  <li>
    Corners are not my strong suit. I found myself slowing down significantly and losing momentum on the course's two tight turns. This is something I need to work on.
  </li>
</ul>
