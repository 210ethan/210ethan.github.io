    Info: 04-05 June 2021 in Palo Duro Canyon
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    Bike: Turner Flux

  <li>
    Place: 2nd in age group (18-34), 6th overall in solo 24-hour MTB
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Friday night was the infamous hill climb that gained jut over 500 ft of elevation in 1.2 miles. I started warming up around 9:30pm expecting a 10:15pm start time, but it was pointless. I ended up getting into my starting position around 9:50pm and waited around. Maybe my legs were primed, maybe they weren't (they probably weren't). In the spirit of fun I was wearing short jorts and a sleeveless denim jacket. The official's voice counted down from five and we were off! And some of us were OFF—they sped away into the night while the rest of us prepared for a long slog up 8-24% grades.
</p>

<p>
  My legs were quickly shocked by the steepness and I shifted into the second-largest gear. Name of the game was smooth pedal strokes at high RPM. After about three minutes the places around me were solidified. Everyone maintained a steady pace without getting out of the saddle. I estimate I finished in the top 10 of about 40 riders, and when considering the stature of some of the racers, is pretty solid for an average guy like me. I screamed down the hill after and we headed back for some much needed sleep.
</p>

<p>
  The main event started at 12:00pm parade-style. An official vehicle led us to the start of the trail about two miles away. The group thinned within 20-30 minutes of being on the singletrack. My first two laps were consecutive and pretty fast at 40:00-45:00 min. The third lap is around when I started to notice a bit of fatigue creeping in, so I shifted to an easier gear and focused on taking things easy, which is especially difficult when people are passing you! Laps continued to get knocked out with a short break after each.
</p>

<p>
  I took a ground nap after lap 10 and was spurred to life by a combination of a caffeine pill and Crafter (music). The caffeine pill was possibly a good idea, but it caused shallow breathing and made my chest feel funny, so I didn't take another one. Night riding was easier than expected. I had a single headlight mounted on my handlebars. The only issue was making turns and not being able to see until my bike was pointed in the path's direction. In lap 1X, the status light on my light turned red, which in turn changed my fear factor to 11 and caused me to start hauling ass to get back to camp. I made it (how close I was I'll never know) and L promptly put a new battery on.
</p>

<p>
  Another short nap delivered me sunlight, a godsend of motivation and energy...and heat! I rode two (?) laps in the morning and called it quits after realizing that I had secured second place in my age group.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I'm happy with this effort considering it's my first 24-hour event and I didn't study any strategy beforehand. I definitely could have done more (probably two laps) had my second place position been threatened. My ability to run on little sleep surprised me, but I think most people would rise to the occasion, especially when they have copious amounts of sugar coursing through their veins.
</p>

<p>
  Lessons learned:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The initial start of any lap was the worst part. Once I got moving everything loosened up and I just pedaled along. This is a huge improvement I can make next time: just get started.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sitting or lying down is a terrible idea and should be avoided at all costs (at least the latter).
  </li>
  <li>
    Having a support crew is required. The alternative is poor performance and absolute misery. Having L get my water and food, clean my bike, talk to me, and give me advice and motivation and a non-exhausted perspective did wonders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dry clothes are important. I rode in my sweat-drenched team kit for the first 10 laps or so and ended up shivering despite it not being that cold out. Apparently dry socks are also very helpful and comfortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Overall comfort in the saddle is of the utmost importance. Discomfort makes getting back on the bike dreadful. The two points of contact are crucial: saddle and grips. Proper saddle height and a comfortable saddle are forgiving on the bum. Cushy grips prevent palm heel bruising.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't hold onto the handlebars with a death grip! My hands were fucked for four days after. I couldn't straighten my fingers and put them together at the same time. Doing certain movement patterns, especially gripping like a handlebar, hurt my entire hand. I think gentler lines and a slower approach would have improved this, not gloves.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My strategy for next time is straightforward and much easier said than done: ride easy the entire time, take 15-minute-maximum breaks (no lying down allowed, sitting acceptable if necessary), change clothes every couple of laps, and force food down.
</p>

<h2 id="tour_de_boerne_2021">Tour de Boerne - 26 June 2021</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info: 26 June 2021, started on Don Strange Ranch
  </li>
  <li>
    Route: 61.38 mi, 3,700 ft elevation gain, 3:47:50 moving time, 16.2 mph average (all according to Strava)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bike: 6KU Fixie
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Race (more of a ride than race) started around 7:15am. I was riding my 6KU Fixie (48/16) My friend (let's call him Alex) and I got out fairly fast, passing quite a few people in the first 5 miles and averaging close to 22 mph on a relatively flat course. And then the hills began. The first one was a bit of a grinder to get up, and the subsequent downhill was unenjoyable due to my having to constantly pedal. My legs were having a tough time, making me unsure if this was just them being cold (I've found my legs take around 45-60 min to warm up) or already failing.
</p>

<p>
  Around the 22 mile mark was the crux of the ride: a 400-ft-tall hill spanning what felt like miles, but whose actual distance I don't know. It just kept going and going, twisting and turning through the Texas hills but never actually flattening. I was out of the saddle the entire time, but not pushing like my other hills—it was just too long!
</p>

<p>
  A Willie Nelson cutout greeted us at the 27 mile mark in Luckenbach, Texas, where we refilled our bottles with Gatorade and water and ate a snack.
</p>

<p>
  Miles 27-late-30s were headwind hell. It never stopped and never shifted. Just a never-ending supply of air gushing directly at us for 10+ miles, forcing us to switch off who was leading and who was drafting. Hills came included, mostly rollers but a few punchy ones here and there.
</p>

<p>
  Mile 45-ish was our final major rest station. The remaining 16 miles were not to be taken lightly. It started off with a steep hill climb that had a few people walking their bikes, then mostly flat until the remaining 4 miles, where the hills returned. At that point they all felt miles long and deathly steep. The cherry on top was descending what we thought was the final climb, only to turn the corner and see what turned out to be the actual final one looming in the distance.
</p>

<p>
  Post-race refreshments included BBQ and two Shiner Bocks.
</p>

<p>
  Thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Riding a fixie was pretty fun, but also sucked. A lot. I will continue to do it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The importance of mental training proves itself yet again.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first_friday_crit_may_2021">First Friday Crit - 07 May 2021</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info: 07 May 2021, 9:35pm start time, off Mission Road in San Antonio, Texas
  </li>
  <li>
    Place: No idea, guessing around 15/25 (guessing on both numbers)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bike: 6KU Fixie
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  First ever bike race! Got in around 9:10pm after struggling to find parking, put my bike together, then stood around talking to a friend while waiting for the women's fixed division to finish up. No stretching, no warm-up, just a six-hour drive to get there. Riders lined up, the organizer took roll, and the race was ready to start in 3..2..1..
</p>

<p>
  Riders up front immediately took off and were instantly in their own race while the rest of us mere mortals were out of the saddle trying to establish a decent position. I ended up in penultimate on the first straight away, but made up ground by the end of the first lap. A nasty headwind was working against us on the middle half of the course, so I proposed helping each other out to another rider, which he graciously accepted. We alternated straights for laps 2-4 (ish, I can't remember exactly) until he dropped (I eventually saw him walking his bike, so I assume he had a mechanical failure). The rest of the race I was in no man's land. The closest rider behind me was quite a ways back, while the one in front had about 10 seconds on me&mdash;a not-insignificant distance.
</p>

<p>
  I was slowly gaining on the rider in front of me, but just couldn't completely close the gap. I glanced behind me and noticed quite a few headlights getting closer and closer...definitely the peloton about to lap me! I pushed through the rest of lap 8 and was passed 30 seconds into lap 9, forcing me to drop out per race rules.
</p>

<p>
  A few thoughts/things to work on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I need to switch to clipless shoes/pedals on the fixie. I'll install some this weekend and work on getting shoes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Working hard to get in someone's draft to avoid wind is much easier than continuing to fight the wind throughout the entire race.
  </li>
  <li>
    Corners are not my strong suit. I found myself slowing down significantly and losing momentum on the course's two tight turns. This is something I need to work on.
  </li>
</ul>
