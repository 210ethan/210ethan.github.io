<h1 id="team">Team vs. Alone</h1>

<p>
  I've never had a true training partner at any point in my life, mostly due to the eccentricity of my training. In high school, no one else really lifted and I mostly did bodyweight work. In college, I continued bodyweight work at the gymnastics facility (where I was considered an outsider) and added more weights, but only did legs once a week with a friend as a social activity. After college, fuggedaboutit—having to get to the gym at 4:30am is undesirable for anyone, especially people more or less my age.
</p>

<p>
  It's also important to note that my progress over the years has been quite poor for a few reasons, but namely consistency. I chose to jump around on programs due to my interests changing, at the expense of getting truly strong. Do I regret this? Yes and no, but that's for another post. I often wonder about is how my progress would have changed had I had a training partner with similar interests and mindsets along the way. Would I have learned everything I have from training alone? Would they have told me to stop <a href="https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/">fucking around</a>? Would I have even listened to them?
</p>

<p>
  While I am fiercely independent and believe most, if not all, motivation and discipline and spurring should be sourced individually and without any external help, it would be naïve to say that training with others does not provide benefits, benefits that aren't offered in solitude.
</p>

  Ultimately, we are all alone. People can be unreliable and disloyal, have higher priorities, change interests. Many friends and family you know will die while you continue living. Relying on yourself is an underrated, under-thought-of skill nowadays. There's nothing wrong with leaning on others for support, but it should only be opted for once the first line of defense has failed: yourself.

<h3 id="pain">Pain</h3>

<p>
  Assuming a half-decent strength and conditioning program is being followed, pain (read: discomfort) in training is inevitable. It will manifest itself in physical form as you continue pedaling, continue rowing, continue squatting, continue moving, despite your body's protestations to immediately stop for its own immediate safety and longevity. It will manifest itself in mental form as you realize you aren't even halfway and the aforementioned objections of continuing forward are already in full force, having been for some time.
</p>

<p>
  Learning to deal with these pain variants independently is important and valuable. Anyone can do so with a cheering crowd next to you or the pressure that someone is relying on you. (Of course, there are situations like these that some people <i>can't</i> do it.) Not everyone can do it when the conditions are uncomfortable and there's no external pressure riding on completion.

<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>

<p>
  Some people's true nature can only be discovered a few ways. Putting a significant amount of pressure on them is one. They may rise to the occasion or succumb to their fragility, both of which are informative. Putting zero pressure on them is another, and my preferred method, as the former can lead to false positives (a weak person rises and a strong one succumbs). They may still rise to an occasion. Which one you ask? Since there's no pressure, the only occasions being created are ones by them, which is informative. A few training-related questions (and my thoughts on each, all of which apply only to those serious about training/fitness) to ask on the path to discovery:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Are you actively involved in your programming, whether doing it yourself or learning the philosophy/science behind what you are using? There's nothing wrong with using someone's already-tested program. However, not being actively involved in learning why it is the way it is points to laziness. Why are you following something you don't understand? What if the fine print reads that this method works for everyone but you, and your program is actually this one? Understanding also allows for modification to improve suitability for yourself. (This gets into the territory of <a href="https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/">fuckarounditis</a>, so be careful.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Are you goal-oriented, or do you just work out to work out (which is <i>not</i> training)? This points to lack of ambition and following the herd.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you quit when discomfort sets in or before the session is finished? This point to mental weakness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you train of your own volition, or does something or someone need to motivate you? This points to lack of ambition. if you reall
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you shy away from certain exercises because you aren't good at them and or/ they are too hard (intensity and/or complexity)?
  </li>
</ul>
