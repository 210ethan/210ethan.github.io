<h1 id="dallas">Dallas Training Partner Ad</h1>

<hr>

<h2 id="summary_purpose">Summary/Purpose</h2>

<p>
  I currently own a home gym in a northern suburb of Dallas, TX and am looking for serious training partners, long-term or stop-in. <b>Please <a href="../about/about.html#contact">contact me</a> with your goals and schedule if you are serious about training together</b>. I do not care about your fitness level (within reason), only that you come ready to work. Cost is 100% free.
</p>

<p>
  I want to create a similar environment to that of Gym Jones in the early- to mid-2000s. For a better idea of what that's like, read the following:
</p>

    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704191640/http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=3">Private</a>

    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704191652/http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=31">Clarity</a>

  <li>
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110618150006/http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=21">Why</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I've come to the conclusion that in order to make significant training progress, having a partner or group makes it much easier and more effective. See <a href="alone.html">Alone vs. Team</a> for specifics.

<h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2>

<p>
  Sessions will generally NOT be traditional weightlifting. Most will be taken from <a href="https://www.spaceprogram.training/">nonprophet's Space Program</a>, or, in other words, flat-out fucking hard.
</p>
