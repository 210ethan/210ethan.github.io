  I am a minimalist in most aspects of my life, but especially when it comes to training. I don't believe in specialized machines that help hit the long head of the small muscle that is rarely used (there are special cases in competitive athletes, but that's for another time); I don't believe in packing more than the bare necessities; I don't believe that gear should be the or a deciding factor on whether or not an objective is achieved.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of gear is two-fold. First, it allows an objective to be accomplished safely. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crampons">crampons</a>, which are used to improve traction on snow and ice. If these weren't used, routes in which crampons are traditionally used would be extremely dangerous or altogether unclimbable. Hence the requirement. Cold-weather clothing is also required for safety, helping to prevent hypothermia or frostbite. Second, it is required to complete the objective, where the objective is <i>not too specific</i> (at some point specialization in training and gear is required to achieve extremely specific goals). Without gear, it would be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve.
</p>

<p>
  Note that comfort is not mentioned in either point. While it's nice to be cool/warm in extreme weather or high on oxygen deep in the Himalayas, by no means is it a requirement and in a sense, takes away from the vividness and prestige of some efforts. Once again, the only purposes of gear are to achieve objectives safely (doing something safely satisfies the second purpose by default). Once those are fulfilled, gear should play no role in whether or not an objective is achieved: personal performance should be the sole controllable factor in determining success. Mt. Everest is contentious among a few circles for the inexperienced mountaineers it attracts. They come in hordes with a few insignificant peaks under their belt, have Sherpas set the fixed ropes and carry their supplementary oxygen, then do the rest of the work by walking up. By no means could any of them summit Everest without the gear (Sherpas, fixed ropes, supplementary oxygen, etc.). They rely on external help rather than training more and summiting legitimately. In Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i>, he quotes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Boukreev">Anatoli Boukreev</a> as saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
  If client cannot climb Everest without big help from guide, this client should not be on Everest. Otherwise there can be big problems up high.
</blockquote>

  How many do you think could summit without help?

<p>
  Training often follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a> in that a majority of adaptations result from a minority of the work, unless the work lacks variation. (I'll hold off on generalizing numbers for each, as the typical 80-20 doesn't necessarily apply to all athletes and can swing wildly in either direction for both numbers. Additionally, the distributions are individualized to specific systems/muscles, not necessarily the athlete as a whole, e.g., 80% of cycling fitness improvements is due to activity X itself, which takes up some percentage of training devoted to improving cycling fitness.)
</p>

<p>
  In looking at specialized equipment and using strength training as an example, there are a <a href="https://watsongym.co.uk/product-category/specialist-bars/">plethora of options</a> out there. Bars for hitting this muscle better, bars for making this movement easier, attachable grips to train that one movement that's never done outside of a gym. The list goes on and will continue to be added to. But these aren't needed. The wheel has already been invented and in use for decades by athletes and trainers more experienced and knowledgable than the guy touting the new Bowflex he just got. To get strong, use a barbell. To go long, go running/cycling/swimming/rowing/hiking. To get flexible, stretch. To lose weight, put the fork down. None of these objectives require expensive, complex tools to achieve.
