<h1 id="supplementary_exercises">Supplementary Exercises</h1>

<p>
  A list of exercises that can be done along side compound strength exercises without interfering with them. The list is sorted into A- B, and C exercises, where A is the most important or useful.
</p>

<h2 id="a_exercises">A Exercises</h2>

<h4 id="shoulder_dislocates">Shoulder Dislocates</h4>

<p>
  Read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2v5smy/the_shoulder_dislocate_a_must_read_for_all">this post</a> and follow its advice.
</p>

<h4 id="shoulder_extension_flexion">Shoulder Extension and Flexion</h4>

<p>
  Shoulder extension and shoulder flexion. Both of these are necessary for an excellent handstand. They should be done weighted, but first start out with none to get used to the range of motion, working up to 10-15kg for the extension and 20kg+ for the flexion. These can be done for reps or for time. You should be conservative in increasing the weight. For flexion, these should be done first until you are comfortable with them: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNrbjJZZ4ys">video 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbyhKCjrPSQ">video 2</a>. You can then begin with a weighted bar and begin moving it backwards overhead, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2NUbu17ZEQ">this video</a>. <a href="#bridge">Bridge</a> is also a good way to gain flexibility in this area. For extension, see <a href="../manna/manna.html#shoulder_extension_retraction">this section</a> of my <a href="../manna/manna.html">Manna tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="shoulder_stabilization">Shoulder Stabilization</h4>

<p>
  Bands are required. This one of the most important ones on the list. The shoulder must be able to stabilize in all different types of positions, especially if it gets out of its normal pattern of movement. Ido Portal has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YHIV4a81Os">video</a> on some exercises, as well as a <a href="http://idoportal.blogspot.com/2009/07/preparations-for-our-daily-training.html.">protocol</a> on how to implement it.
</p>

<h4 id="scapular_mobilization">Scapular Mobilization</h4>

<p>
  Bands are required. This is one of the most important on the list as well. All is said in <a href="http://idoportal.blogspot.com/2009/07/scapula-mobilization-and-sequences.html">Ido’s blog post</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="grip_strength">Grip Strength</h4>

<p>
  A basic beginner's routine can be found <a href="http://www.davidhorne-gripmaster.com/basics.html">here</a>.
</p>


(A) Bridges. The bridge is a basic position that provides great mobility benefits for both the shoulder joint and thoracic spine. The best method to develop your bridge without any weaknesses, also while developing great shoulder extension strength, is to buy GymnasticBodies’ Foundation series. If you’re not willing to pay $80-$275, then that’s fine. The next best tutorial is from GymnasticWOD. They help you build up to it even if you have no experience. http://gymnasticswod.com/content/bridge-progressions-pt1

(A) Hanging. Before you begin, no, you should not do large doses of hanging like in Ido’s infamous 7-minute hang challenge (hanging for 7 minutes a day). However, smaller doses of hanging can do wonders for the shoulder joint. Read the following blog posts by Ido, from bottom to top: http://www.idoportal.com/blog/page/2/.





<h2 id="b_exercises">B Exercises</h2>


(B) Wrist novel movements. These are an excellent wrist conditioning exercise that you can do almost anywhere. I like to do these twice a day, 10-15x each. To make it more challenging, you can do the both wrists at the same time.

(B) Cuban Rotations. Post by Ido Portal. “I first read about the concept of Structural Balance years ago from an article written by Charles Poliquin. Poliquin described a certain relationship that should be achieved between various upper body movement patterns (notice I am careful not to say 'muscles' here) but more importantly educated me about the need for specific shoulder stabilizers conditioning.

While trying to apply some of these concepts I became a big fan of the 'Cuban Rotation' as one of the most 'bang for your buck' exercises for upper body structural balance.

The Cuban Rotation entails an external rotation motion of the upper arms in an upright, 90-90 degrees both in shoulder and in the elbow joints. (Some of you may know the Cuban Press, but I find it a waste of time to include the Upright Row and the Press motion where the weight is basically held back by the Rotation portion of the lift)

A good long term goal with the Cuban Rotation is to aspire for a HALF BODYWEIGHT lifted for 5 reps with at least 3 sec eccentrics. Some of you may laugh, but this is no crazier than doing a One Arm Chin Up and will keep your shoulders healthy and strong while allowing further development of the internal rotators as well, as balance sets in.

Training with the Cuban Rotation should be performed 2-3 times a week for 3-7 sets at a time. Rep ranges can vary as you should start with lower intensity and work your way through to lower rep sets.

If you can have one goal out of 5 to balance all your upper body strength training I would put the 50%BW Cuban Rotation as that goal. Try it and you will be surprised how good your shoulders feel and how the rest of your strength training is effected. Enjoy!”

(B) Hollow body strength. While these are covered in the warmup, they can and should be trained more. Core endurance is important in all types of training, and HB work will get you there. Work up 5x30-60s/r for tuck holds, tuck rocks, straddle holds, straddle rocks, full holds, full rocks. Rock are demonstrated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgV51C4ebRs.

(B) Balance work. The frog stand is the most basic handbalancing position. From there you can move onto air baby and straight arm frog stand, then tuck planche. Elbow lever is another basic handbalancing position. Once you get the two armed version down, you can do the one armed version (Crocodile).

For frog stand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hml31hm-Zkg
For elbow lever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcDjtLoM91g


(B) Pancake. The pancake stretch is imperative if you want to achieve a press handstand, Manna, or just want to be flexible. The best resource by far is Kit Laughlin’s Master the Pancake, found here: http://kitlaughlin.com/forums/index.php?/topic/543-master-the-pancake-live-today/. It truly is a great resource written by an even better teacher, so consider spending $10 to get more flexible and support Kit. Another much more basic, but effective, method is to simply use weights to get you deeper into the stretch (loaded progressive stretching). Go ahead and watch Emmet’s video on this before you begin: Emmet's Blackboard: Loaded Progressive Stretching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=askyPISMogs.

(B) Pike. The pike is a basic gymnastic stretch, and is important if you want a press handstand, Manna, V-sit, L-sit, or just want to be flexible. Once again, the best resource is Kit’s Master the Pike, found here: http://kitlaughlin.com/forums/index.php?/topic/676-master-the-pike-live-today/. You can also do LPS, in the form of static seating or standing pike, or Jefferson curls. Be careful about increasing weight on these.

(B) Side splits. The side splits is important in any straddle element, as the wider your splits, the greater leverage you have. The horse stance is the best method to get there, along with having great hip mobility (another Kit product here: http://kitlaughlin.com/forums/index.php?/topic/514-master-the-squat-and-hip-mobility-live-today/). FitnessFAQs’ tutorial is great (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JApz7PKMbw), as is Antranik’s (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXWtk3NLESk), and, of course, Emmet’s (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvOPOuhtczg). In my opinion, you should work up to 5x2:00-3:00 before adding any weight, of which some people are opposed to while others enjoy it. The weight should be upped in very small increments every 2-4 weeks, or until you feel ready.

(B) Front (left/right) splits. The GymnasticBodies Front Splits course is one of the best resource out there, but if you’re not willing to spend $85, no worries. Here is a great Technique Thursday from our very own m092: https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/356cyq/technique_thursday_front_splits/.

(B) Wall slides. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6V2Exzb324. An excellent exercise for increasing shoulder girdle flexibility. Follow Coach Sommer’s guide here: https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/forum/topic/846-wall-extensions/#entry6146.

<h2 id="c_exercises">C Exercises</h2>

(C) Finger strength. This can be in the form of pulling or pushing. For pushing, you can start with a standard plank. Work up to at least 60s of all five fingers, then remove the pinky, then ring, and so on. Working up to 60s each time will ensure the tendons of the hand and fingers are ready, as they take much longer to adapt/recover than muscles (~10x). For pulling, you can start with basic hanging in the row position and deadhang. Same protocol for this. Work up to 60s for each combination, starting with four fingers (unless you can’t hang already).

(C) Breath holding. Post by Ido Portal. Breath hold (Static Apnea) is a technology for meditation. When many disciplines and practices TALK about meditation and emptying, breath holding is the pudding behind the proof.
It’s a way to insert a classic measure into the most romantic of pursuits. It’s not perfect but still - it is insightful as hell! Follow the sequence:

Empty your lungs.

Take a deep full breath. (huge subject but we will keep it simple for now)

Start the stop watch, close your eyes and empty your mind, relax all muscles and drift into the peaceful darkness.

When you cannot continue anymore - stop the watch and regain breathing.

You can follow CO2 and O2 tolerance tables as outlined in this: http://freedivingexplained.blogspot.com/2008/03/freediving-training-static-tables.html.

(C) Head-to-toe. An uncommon but very beneficial stretch for hamstring and calf flexibility. Watch these two videos in order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs-iOux0zps / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HVsDRjOHqU. Of course you must have the prerequisites (palm to floor pike, 5x5-10 25% BW Jefferson curl) to begin this, so if you don’t, get working on them! H2T transfers very well to pike, but not necessarily vice versa.

(C) Ankle prehab. A common weak link in most athlete’s training, the ankles need to be both mobile and strong for all types of movement types, from basketball and soccer to martial arts. Dogen puts together an excellent ankle strengthening tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1XvEbJUKE.

(C) Compression. Both pike and pancake compression are important for Manna/V/L-sit, press handstands, and hanging leg lifts. Compression is the ability to close the hip angle, like in a V-sit. It is a significant component in performing L-sits as well. Good compression requires both good flexibility in the back of the leg and solid strength in the front of the leg and the abdominals. Compression work aims to improve these two qualities at the same time. If your goals are V-sit or press handstands, you'd better get to it! Here's how it goes:

Do a posterior chain stretch, like a deep lunge where you push the hips back (you'll have to do both legs, check this video for a demonstration). Hold this for 30s-60s.

Sit on the floor with your legs out straight.

Put your hands somewhere along your legs. The further they are, the harder it is.

Lift your feet while slightly pushing down through your hands, like so or for a different type of compression, like so (images from drillsandskills.com). The first variation is good for L-sits and V-sits, while the second variation is good for Straddle-L and press handstands. (Last image gives examples: http://www.drillsandskills.com/article/16).

Hold for 10 seconds.

Repeat 4-5 times.

You can do compression work after your workouts, or on off days.
