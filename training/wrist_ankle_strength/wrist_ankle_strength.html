<h1>Wrist and Ankle Strength</h1>

<p>
  A few notes before beginning:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Before strength is gained in any position, the position's mobility must be developed.
  </li>
  <li>
    There <i>is</i> such thing as perfect alignment, but it's uncommon and often the best-case scenario. Train for worst-case scenario (poor alignment), because it WILL happen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Why train wrists and ankles? Both are the required blocks to basic human movement. Walking, running, and standing require the ankles. Activities requiring basic dexterity use the wrists, among other common tasks (typing, writing).
  </li>
  <li>
    For all stretches, no discomfort should be felt nor limits pushed.
  </li>
  <li>
    For all strength exercises, progression should be gradual and not forced. (This will be mentioned a few times.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrists">Wrists</h2>

<p>
  There are a few different types of <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-3-wrist">wrist movement</a>: flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation.
</p>

<h3 id="wrist_mobility">Wrist Mobility</h3>

<p>
  Five types of wrist strength exercises will be performed. Because these exercises target the tendons, the progression of each should be very gradual and only done by increasing the ROM. All stretches should be done on the knees.
</p>

<p>
  All wrist stretches can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each stretch's description):
</p>

<h4 id="pronated_flexion">Pronated Flexion</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place the hands flat on the ground (palms down) with fingers pointing forwards
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forward at the shoulders while keeping the palms grounded
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:00
</p>

<h4 id="supinated_flexion">Supinated Flexion</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place the top of the hands (palms up) flat on the ground with fingers pointing backwards
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean back at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:12

<h4 id="pronated_extension">Pronated Extension</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place the hands flat on the ground (palms down) with fingers pointing backwards
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean back at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

<h4 id="supinated_extension">Supinated Extension</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place the hands flat on the ground (palms up) with fingers pointing forwards
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forwards at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:30
</p>

<h4 id="ulnar_deviation">Ulnar Deviation</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make a fist, then place the top of the fist flat on the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean backwards at the shoulders while keeping the top of the fists grounded
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:40
</p>

<h4 id="radial_deviation">Radial Deviation</h4>

<p>
  There is no good stretch that targets radial deviation since the ROM is so small.
</p>

<h3 id="wrist_strength">Wrist Strength</h3>

<p>
  Three types of wrist strength exercises will be performed. Because these exercises target the tendons, the progression of each should be very gradual and only done with increasing the amount of bodyweight used. Never work to failure or pain. Increasing reps is preferable to adding weight when the full version is reached.
</p>

<p>
  Typical progression:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <b>Wall</b>: Start with no lean (90° between body and ground) and get used to the movement. Slowly increase lean (decrease body-ground angle).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Knees</b>: Like knee pushups, use knees to support the movement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Plank</b>: Perform the movement in a full plank.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Handstand</b>: Perform the movement in a handstand. To make this easier, enter into a chest-to-wall handstand and walk the hands away from the wall. This removes weight from the wrists.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  All wrists exercises and progressions can be found in the following video (timestamps are next to each exercise):

<h4 id="wrist_pushup">Wrist Pushup (WPU)</h4>


<p>
  Wrist pushup procedure for variation 1 is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make a right angle at the first knuckle between the fingers and palm with the fingers in a straight line
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the fingers flat on the ground and align the first knuckle, wrist, and shoulder
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter plank (if doing these in handstand, enter in handstand, then create the correct finger/hand position)
  </li>
  <li>
    As you descend, drop the back of the hand onto the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    When pushing back up and nearing the top, "pop" the back of the hand back up into its original position
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To perform variation 2, simply keep both the back of the hand and fingers on the ground and perform pushups. Note that getting full lockout on the plank is limited by the wrists' mobility.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    WPU Variation 1 (Knees): 0:00
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU Variation 1 (Plank): 0:06
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU Variation 2 (Knees): 0:13
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU Variation 2 (Plank): 0:22
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU Variation 2 (Handstand):
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="first_knuckle_pushup">First Knuckle Pushup (FKP)</h4>

<p>
  First knuckle pushup procedure is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Enter plank with both hands flat on the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    While keeping the fingers grounded, use the knuckles to lift the wrist
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    FKP (Knees): 0:29
  </li>
  <li>
    FKP (Plank): 0:35
  </li>
  <li>
    FKP (Handstand):
  </li>
</ul>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYBzwF6-kCI?start=108"></iframe>

<h4 id="deviation_rolls">Deviation Rolls (DR)</h4>

<p>
  Deviation roll procedure is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Enter plank with fists
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forward while rotating the fists so the side of the index finger and top of thumb are making contact with the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean backwards until the original position is reached
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean backwards while bending the elbows and rotating the wrists so the little finger is making contact with the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forwards and straight the elbows until the original position is reached
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    DR (Knees): 0:46
  </li>
  <li>
    DR (Plank): 0:58
  </li>
  <li>
    (No DR in handstand found. Please <a href="../../about/about_me.html#contact">contact me</a> if you have seen DR in handstand.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="other_wrist_exercises">Other Wrist Exercises</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlWgH3_0NU">Novel movements</a> for hand, wrist, and elbow. These are helpful to do once per day for 10-15 reps per exercise.
</p>

<h3 id="wrist_training_schedule">Wrist Training Schedule</h3>

<p>
  Wrist exercises need only be done once per week for 1-2 sets per exercise. These can be done at the end of a training session or in a standalone session.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Stretches: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU: 1-2x5-15 rep
  </li>
  <li>
    FKP: 1-2x5-15 rep
  </li>
  <li>
    DR: 1-2x5-15 rep
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The wrist strength you develop from these does not go away quickly—I have not done these in over a year, but was able to do sets of 10 with no warm-up.
</p>

























<h2 id="ankles">Ankles</h2>

<p>
  There are a few different types of <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-7-the-ankle">ankle movement</a>: dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, eversion, lateral rotation, and medial rotation.
</p>

<h3 id="ankle_mobility">Ankle Mobility</h3>

<p>
  Six type of ankle stretches will be performed, each corresponding to one of the types of movements. They can be done in reps or held for time. All ankle stretches can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each stretch's description):
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_BVZ2knSKY"></iframe>

<h4 id="dorsiflexion_stretch">Dorsiflexion Stretch (DFSc)</h4>

<p>
  The dorsiflexion stretch can be done on one (preferable) or two legs. Simply keep the entire foot grounded and move the knees as far forward as possible. The <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus">soleus</a> is primarily stretched. Depending on the amount of weight and lean, this can double as a strength exercise.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:06
</p>

<h4 id="plantarflexion_stretch">Plantarflexion Stretch (PFSc)</h4>

<p>
  The plantarflexion stretch (PFSc) is done on one leg at a time. Take one leg, curl the toes down so they touch the ground, then move the ankle forward.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:19
</p>

<h4 id="inversion_stretch">Inversion Stretch (ISc)</h4>

<p>
  The inversion stretch can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the outside, so the larger toes come off the ground.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:34
</p>

<h4 id="eversion_stretch">Eversion Stretch (ESc)</h4>

<p>
  The eversion stretch can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the inside, so the smaller toes come off the ground. The ESc range-of-motion is much less than the ISc ROM.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:56
</p>

<h4 id="lateral_rotation_stretch">Lateral Rotation Stretch (LRSc)</h4>

<p>
  The lateral rotation stretch is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, to the inside of the planted foot without moving it.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 2:07
</p>

<h4 id="medial_rotation_stretch">Medial Rotation Stretch (MRSc)</h4>

<p>
  The medial rotation stretch is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, to the outside of the planted foot without moving it.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 1:15
</p>

<h3 id="ankle_strength">Ankle Strength</h3>

<p>
  Dogen's Titanium Ankles tutorial (see below) is a great resource for general ankle strength:
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21rwl0oWwuY?start=133"></iframe>

<p>
  Other strength exercises are simply variations of the stretches. The exercises can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each stretch's description):
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0PtUa7rEUc"></iframe>

<h4 id="dorsiflexion_strength">Dorsiflexion Strength (DFSg)</h4>

<p>
  Similar to the stretch, attempt to hold for longer and with minimal external support.
</p>

<h4 id="plantarflexion_strength">Plantarflexion Strength (PFSg)</h4>

<p>
  PF strength is tough to train, as well as a bit dangerous. The best method seems to be a variation of the <a href="#plantarflexion_stretch">PFSc</a>, but with support. Using a counter/parallel bars/etc, enter into full support, then position both feet in the PF stretch position. Slowly decrease the support the arms are giving (increase bodyweight used) to load the muscles.
</p>

<p>
  (Note: I strained my shins doing this, so be careful!)
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:00
</p>

<h4 id="inversion_strength">Inversion Strength (ISg)</h4>

<p>
  There are three options for inversion strength, all of which can be used.
</p>

<p>
  The first exercise is simply walking while inverted: after getting into the stretch position, simply begin walking. This loads all of the bodyweight onto one ankle momentarily and can be scaled by supporting the body with the arms.
</p>

<p>
  The second exercise is jumping while in inversion, like Ido Portal does in the <a href="https://youtu.be/HHn-Hk8OBSo?t=55">video above</a>. Doing this on a soft surface is recommended. To progress, jump higher, with weight, or on one leg.
</p>

<p>
  The third exercise is one-leg inversion holds. Simply invert one ankle and stand on it for time. Weight can be added as needed.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:13
</p>

<h4 id="eversion_strength">Eversion Strength (ESg)</h4>

<p>
  Eversion strength exercises are the same as inversion, albeit more awkward: eversion walks, eversion jumps, and eversion holds.
</p>

<p>
  Timestamp: 0:45
</p>

<h4 id="lateral_medial_rotation_strength">Lateral and Medial Rotation Strength (LRSg, MRSg)</h4>

<p>
  Both lateral and medial rotation strength can be trained through Dogen's <a href="https://youtu.be/21rwl0oWwuY?t=399">lateral isometrics</a> (6:39 on the video): push against the wall with both the inside and outside of the foot to train both types.
</p>

<h3 id="ankle_training_schedule">Ankle Training Schedule</h3>

<p>
  Ankle exercises will be done only once per week for 1-2 sets per exercise. These can be done at the end of a training session or in a standalone session.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Stretches: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    DFSg: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    PFSg: 1x30-60s
  </li>
  <li>
    ISg: 50-100 steps or 2x5-10 jumps or 1x30 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    ESg: 50-100 steps or 2x5-10 jumps or 1x30 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    LRSg: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    MRSg: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The ankle strength you develop from these does not go away quickly—I have not done these in over a year, but was able to do all exercises with no warm-up.
