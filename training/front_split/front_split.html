<h1>Front Split Tutorial</h1>

<p>
  The front split is a basic flexibility position found in gymnastics, acrobatics, yoga, and other disciplines.
</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>
  Front split (FS) is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Left FS = left leg is forward and right leg is back. Vice versa for right FS.
  </li>
  <li>
    Front and back leg are approximately 180° apart.
  </li>
  <li>
    Front leg is in complete contact with the ground with the foot, calf, hamstring, and glute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Back leg is in contact with ground at top of foot, shin, quad. The hip flexor is not required to touch the ground.
  </li>
  <li>
    Must hold for at least 10 sec (bouncing into or holding the position momentarily doesn't qualify).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  FS requires basic leg mobility and strength:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    30 sec standing active pike stretch with palms on floor. No pulling yourself down - your hamstrings should do all of the work.
  </li>
  <li>
    10x 95-135 lb Romanian deadlift. This is basic hamstring strength and flexibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    10x 95-135lb back squat. This is basic hamstring and quad strength and flexibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    60s <a href="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/2010/08/32/2/192/1922729/919ac0fbf1600d8f_sleeping-hero-pose.jpg">laying quad stretch</a>. This should feel like a resting position.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="progressions">Progressions</h2>

<h3 id="supplementary_stretches">Supplementary Stretches</h3>

<p>
  I used two supplementary stretches (SS1, SS2) prior to the main FS stretch. The supplementary stretches are meant to warm up the muscles you will be using during the actual FS, as well as "reverse-engineer" stretch the muscles you will be using for the FS.
</p>

<h4 id="ss1">SS1: Deep Lunge</h4>

<p>
  The stretch should be felt in the hamstring and groin on the front leg and the quad and hip flexor on the rear leg. Using a hand for balance is fine, but use minimally - most of the work should be coming from your legs. You should be up on your toes on the rear leg and trying to drive your hips towards the ground without moving your feet.
</p>

    </figcaption>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="ss2">SS2: Quad Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The stretch should be felt only in the quad and hip flexor of the rear leg. With the foot pointed, attempt to pull your sole flat against your body, keeping the lower leg (calf) in line with the upper leg (thigh).
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="front_split">Front Split</h3>

<p>
  After performing both SS1 and SS2, your legs should be properly warmed-up and ready for the FS itself. Performing the FS on a low-friction (not frictionless) surface, such as hardwood or carpet, is a good option, as it allows you to slide into the stretch and forces you to use strength to keep from going too deep.
</p>

<p>
  My preferred method of entering FS is to get on one knee (90° between calf and thigh) with the other leg pointed straight out in front. Slowly move the front leg's foot out to begin the stretch. A good demonstration is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rSWYkgejng">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="advanced_progressions">Advanced Progressions</h3>

<p>
  Progressions past a standard FS should only be worked on once the following is achieved:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    3-5x60 sec FS. Once you are completely warmed up, you should not feel much, if any, of a stretch, especially in the groin and hip flexor area.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cold FS. You should be able to drop into FS or close-to on command or with a short warm up).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are two progressions past standard FS: ground oversplit (GOS) and supported oversplit (SOS).
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="ground_oversplit">Ground Oversplit (GOS)</h4>

<p>
  GOS can be approached two ways: elevating the front leg or elevating the back leg.  I've found the front leg to be easier and more natural. Elevation should progress in 1 in. increments, with at least 2-3 sessions at the same height to allow your body to acclimate. Work back up to a comfortable 3-5x60s before increasing the elevation.
</p>

<h4 id="supported_oversplit">Supported Oversplit (SOS)</h4>

<p>
  The support oversplit is progressed by simply moving the supports closer to your feet. I suggest starting with your lower leg (knee and below) supported to get used to it. Once you get back up to 3-5x60s, decrease the support on one leg while keeping the other leg's support the same. An example progression would be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Both lower legs supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    Back lower leg support, front lower leg minus 1-2 in. (support goes towards the feet, making it more difficult) support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Back lower leg minus 2 in. support, front lower leg minus 2 in. support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue until just the feet are supported.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example_training_session">Example Training Session</h2>

<p>
  I prefer to do my FS work after any leg exercises to ensure they are completely warm and prevent interference with strength work.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example FS session:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    2-3 min basic leg stretching: hamstring, groin, hip, and quads.
  </li>
  <li>
    2-3 sets of 30-60 sec SS1 (each leg). Rest is up to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    2-3 sets of 30-60 sec SS2 (each leg). Rest is up to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    3-5 sets of 30-60 sec FS. Rest at least 60 sec between sets. You can use your hands to balance, but they should not be supporting any weight.
  </li>
</ol>
