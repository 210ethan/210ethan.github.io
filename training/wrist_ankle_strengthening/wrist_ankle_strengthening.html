<h1>Wrist and Ankle Strengthening</h1>

<p>
  A few notes before beginning:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Before strength is gained in any position, the position's mobility must be developed.
  </li>
  <li>
    There <i>is</i> such thing as perfect alignment, but it's uncommon and often the best-case scenario. Train for worst-case scenario (poor alignment), because it WILL happen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Why train wrists and ankles? Both are the required blocks to basic human movement. Walking, running, and standing require the ankles. Activities requiring basic dexterity use the wrists, among other common tasks (typing, writing).
  </li>
  <li>
    For all stretches, no discomfort should be felt nor limits pushed.
  </li>
  <li>
    For all strength exercises, progression should be gradual and not forced. (This will be mentioned a few times.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrists">Wrists</h2>

<p>
  There are a few different types of <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-3-wrist">wrist movement</a>: flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation.
</p>

<h3 id="wrist_mobility">Wrist Mobility</h3>

<p>
  Six types of wrist stretches will be performed.
</p>

<h4 id="ulnar_deviation">Ulnar Deviation</h4>






<h4 id="radial_deviation">Radial Deviation</h4>




<h3 id="wrist_strength">Wrist Strength</h3>

<p>
  Three types of wrist strength exercises will be performed. Because these exercises target the tendons, the progression of each should be very gradual and only done with increasing the amount of bodyweight used. Never work to failure or pain. Increasing reps is preferable to adding weight when the full version is reached.
</p>

<p>
  Typical progression:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <b>Wall</b>: Start with no lean (90° between body and ground) and get used to the movement. Slowly increase lean (decrease body-ground angle).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Knees</b>: Like knee pushups, use knees to support the movement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Plank</b>: Perform the movement in a full plank.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Handstand</b>: Perform the movement in a handstand. To make this easier, enter into a chest-to-wall handstand and walk the hands away from the wall. This removes weight from the wrists.
  </li>
</ol>




<h4 id="wrist_pushup">Wrist Pushup</h4>


<p>
  Wrist pushup (WPU) procedure for variation 1 is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make a right angle at the first knuckle between the fingers and palm with the fingers in a straight line
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the fingers flat on the ground and align the first knuckle, wrist, and shoulder
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter plank (if doing these in handstand, enter in handstand, then create the correct finger/hand position)
  </li>
  <li>
    As you descend, drop the back of the hand onto the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    When pushing back up and nearing the top, "pop" the back of the hand back up into its original position
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To perform variation 2, simply keep both the back of the hand and fingers on the ground and perform pushups. Note that getting full lockout on the plank is limited by the wrists' mobility.

<h4 id="first_knuckle_pushup">First Knuckle Pushup</h4>

<p>
  First knuckle pushup (FKP) procedure is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Enter plank with both hands flat on the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    While keeping the fingers grounded, use the knuckles to lift the wrist
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="deviation_rolls">Deviation Rolls</h4>

<p>
  Deviation roll (DR) procedure is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Enter plank with fists
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forward while rotating the fists so the side of the index finger and top of thumb are making contact with the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean backwards until the original position is reached
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean backwards while bending the elbows and rotating the wrists so the little finger is making contact with the ground
  </li>
  <li>
    Lean forwards and straight the elbows until the original position is reached
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="other_wrist_exercises">Other Wrist Exercises</h4>

<h3 id="wrist_training_schedule">Wrist Training Schedule</h3>

<p>
  Wrist exercises will be done only once per week for 1-2 sets per exercise. These can be done at the end of a training session or in a standalone session.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Stretches: 1x30-60 sec
  </li>
  <li>
    WPU: 1-2x5-15
  </li>
  <li>
    FKP: 1-2x5-15
  </li>
  <li>
    DR: 1-2x5-15
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The wrist strength you develop from these does not go away quickly—I have not done these in over a year, but was able to do sets of 10 with no warm-up.
</p>

























<h2 id="ankles">Ankles</h2>

<p>
  There are a few different types of <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-7-the-ankle">ankle movement</a>: dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, eversion, lateral rotation, and medial rotation.
</p>

<h3 id="ankle_mobility">Ankle Mobility</h3>

<p>
  Six type of ankle stretches will be performed, each corresponding to one of the types of movements. They can be done in reps or held for time.
</p>

<h4 id="dorsiflexion_stretch">Dorsiflexion Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The dorsiflexion stretch (DS) can be done on one (preferable) or two legs. Simply keep the entire foot grounded and move the knees as far forward as possible. The <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus">soleus</a> is primarily stretched. Depending on the amount of weight and lean, this can double as a strength exercise.
</p>

<figcaption align="middle">

<h4 id="plantarflexion_stretch">Plantarflexion Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The plantarflexion stretch (PS) is done on one leg at a time. Take one leg, curl the toes down so they touch the ground, then move the ankle forward.
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_BVZ2knSKY?start=19"></iframe>
<figcaption align="middle">

<h4 id="inversion_stretch">Inversion Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The inversion stretch (IS) can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the outside, so the larger toes come off the ground.
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_BVZ2knSKY?start=34"></iframe>
<figcaption align="middle">

<h4 id="eversion_stretch">Eversion Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The eversion stretch (ES) can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the inside, so the smaller toes come off the ground. The ES range-of-motion is much less than the IS ROM.
</p>

<figcaption align="middle">

<h4 id="lateral_rotation_stretch">Lateral Rotation Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The lateral rotation stretch (LRS) is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, to the inside of the planted foot without moving it.
</p>

<iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_BVZ2knSKY?start=127"></iframe>
<figcaption align="middle">

<h4 id="medial_rotation_stretch">Medial Rotation Stretch</h4>

<p>
  The medial rotation stretch (MRS) is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, to the outside of the planted foot without moving it.
</p>
