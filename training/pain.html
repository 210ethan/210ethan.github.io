Scope
This article is meant to give a comprehensive view of what pain is: its biological pathways, how it affects our performance, and increasing our tolerance of pain.

Pain Defined
Pain is formally defined as "physical suffering or distress, as due to injury, illness, etc." [pain def] Over the course of this paper, pain will only refer primarily to physical pain and fatigue - any other types of pain, such as mental, will only be referenced if it stems from physical pain. Pain tolerance may also be referred to as "mental toughness", although the two are not completely synonymous.
There are two generally accepted types of pain: nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain [two types of pain].
Nociceptive Pain
Nociceptive pain is what people generally think of pain being caused by an event. Nociceptors are neurons that are "sensitive to a noxious stimulant or to a stimulus that would become noxious if prolonged" [nociceptor def]. In other words, they are neurons that detect harm being done to your body. Harm can include temperature (extreme cold or heat), pressure (being crushed by a heavy object), or chemicals (acid burning your skin). External nociceptors are located at skin-level to support the dermis and/or epidermis and the eye at the cornea and internal nociceptors are located in most organs. Both external and internal nociceptors come in C-fibers (more common) and A-fibers (Aβ and Aδ). Stimuli threshold vary between C- and A-fibers (I am not sure why A-fiber mechanic threshold has not been tested on humans):

	C-fiber	A-fiber
Heat Threshold	39-51 °C	43-47 °C
Mechanical Threshold	30 mN (human)	11-15 bar (monkey)
Action Potential Travel Rate [travel rates]	2 m/s	20 m/s
Once thresholds are reached, the nociceptor sends electricity towards the central nervous system (CNS) in the form of an action potential. Due to the difference in action potential travel times to the CNS, pain is felt in two variations: A-fibers carry a fast, sharp pain, while C-fibers carry a slower, dull pain.
Thermal nociceptors exist solely to detect damaging temperatures, both hot and cold. The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) serves as a thermal nociceptor, as well as body temperature regulator. It activates (sends a pain signal in the form of an action potential) around 43 °C [trpv1 activation temp]. Mechanical nociceptors detect pressure and skin damage. Chemical nociceptors can respond to spices, such as capsaicin (component of peppers), and other irritants.
Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain is formally defined as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system" [neuropathic pain def] and is a type of chronic pain. There are two types: central and peripheral, referring to the type of somatosensory nervous system the damage is done to. It does not necessarily immediately trigger a response like nociceptive pain. Rather, the pain may be constant or random. Causes include injuries to nerves, infection (such as HIV), and disease (multiple sclerosis).
After nerves are damaged, they can regenerate and become hyper-sensitive (peripheral sensitization) or defective, causing amplified or modified sensory signals to be sent to the brain; they are then processed as pain.
Central neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the central nervous system, i.e. the spinal cord or brain. Peripheral neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the aforementioned A- and C-fibers.
Pain (Discomfort) Caused by Exercise
Fatigue during exercise is the body's method of protecting you from danger. By limiting your output and preventing you from working at your maximum strength, you will not get injured. This failsafe can be overridden in some situations (hysterical strength). During exercise, muscles are constantly exerting themselves and create byproducts, such as phosphates, protons, lactate, and Mg2+ [exercise and fatigue]. Cytokines are released by cells and affect organs, sometimes even triggering nociceptors [cytokines nociceptors].

Increasing Pain Tolerance and Threshold
This section will discuss increasing pain (also called discomfort for clarity) tolerance and threshold in different circumstances.
Pain tolerance is defined as the amount of pain/discomfort you can withstand before you decide or need to stop. For example, if you are running and begin to feel discomfort, but continue running for another 30 minutes, you are tolerating the pain.
Pain threshold is defined as the minimum amount of pain/discomfort you can notice. For example, an untrained athlete would feel discomfort quickly if trying to run a 6:00 minute mile. However, a professional runner would feel no discomfort at all. It can be said that the professional runner has a higher pain threshold than the untrained athlete (in that specific situation).
The experiments will be measured in terms of rate of perceived effort or pain (RPE, RPP). This is a somewhat universal measurement of pain tolerance, as it is relative for each person - if person A can maintain an RPE/P of 10 for 60 seconds, while person B can maintain an RPE of 10 for 45 seconds, person A has a higher pain tolerance, regardless of their absolute strengths.
I hypothesize that pain tolerance increases as a function of time spent in pain. That is, if you spend more time exercising near the upper limits of your pain tolerance, your pain tolerance will increase.
Sheer Pain


Pain (Discomfort) During Exercise
I will use studies, anecdotal evidence, and personal experimentation to study increasing exercise pain tolerance.
Studies


Anecdotal Evidence
The following are T Nation's Dan Blewett's perspective on mental toughness, as well as some of my own thoughts mixed in:

There are four aspects to increasing mental toughness:
	1. Mental toughness can be built through challenging experiences.
	2. Consistency is key.
	3. Competition helps.
	4. Identify and fix your weaknesses.
To develop champion-level toughness, you need to rise to challenges and complete them. Blewett suggests challenging yourself one day per week to a grueling workout. This is important for a few reasons. For one, it will show you how much more you have in the tank than you think you do. Take BUD/S (the Navy SEAL selection course), for example. During Phase I, candidates participate in the infamous five-and-a-half day "Hell Week", in which they reportedly sleep for less than four hours (total) and exercise for up to 20 hours per day. After hearing this, one of two thoughts runs through your head: that's impossible or I can't do that. Yet thousands have successfully completed Hell Week. All this goes to show that you are capable of much more than you think.
Consistency is key. It requires discipline and determination. Many people want to switch up routines after they get bored or start to see progress stalling. By continuing on with the program (not pointlessly long, though. If something isn't working, you should change), you are building consistency, and thus mental toughness.
Competitive. Blewett says the problem is that "you admit defeat and think nothing of it" and the solution is "grow a pair. Compete with the bar and don't let inanimate objects beat you." Toughness differs from competitiveness. Competition is an internal drive to win, toughness is the internal discipline to not quit. The solution to a lack of competition goes back to bullet #1 – find something you may not be able to do, and do it. Too many people are scared of pain and failure and don't know how to compete. The best lifters I've ever met are also the most competitive with the iron – they refuse to be beaten by it and don't accept defeat by an exercise or a weight. If the bar staples you, don't shrug your shoulders and move on. Feel slighted. Feel embarrassed. Feel beaten. It may not be appropriate to jump back under and hurt yourself trying, but if you don't feel the sting of defeat, you're probably better served by the elliptical.
Resolute is defined as admirably purposeful, determined, and unwavering. Those who are resolute continue to get back up after defeats in search of new ways to conquer their goals.


Experiments
Three exercises will be performed with the respective tests:
	1. Plank hold: maximum hold.
	2. Mid-distance sprinting of 400-800 m: fastest time.
	3. Stairmaster or incline treadmill: pre-set speed (and incline, if treadmill) and maximum time.
All of these will be performed at maximal effort. I will take note of the times in which I reach and hold RPE 7, 8, 9, 10. RPE 1-6 are not included, as those are not close to maximum pain tolerance nor challenging to withstand. Examples for each exercise are below.
During a plank hold I reach RPE 7 at 1:45, RPE 8 at 2:15, RPE 9 at 2:30, RPE 10 at 2:45, and stopping at 2:55.

RPE	Duration (s)
7	30
8	15
9	15
10	10
During an 800 m sprint, I reach RPE 7 at 0:45, RPE 8 at 1:05, RPE 9 at 1:30, RPE 10 at 2:00, and finish at 2:30.

RPE	Duration (s)
7	20
8	25
9	30
10	30
The ultimate goal is to increase time spent at the higher RPEs, which indicates an increase in pain tolerance, since RPE is a (somewhat) universal measure. For example, after my experimentation, the plank table would go from:
RPE	Duration (s)
7	30
8	15
9	15
10	10
to:
RPE	Duration (s)
7	40
8	25
9	25
10	20


Temperature Pain (Discomfort)
The Wim Hof Method (WHM)
Wim "The Iceman" Hof is known for his feats of withstanding extreme temperatures, including running a barefoot half-marathon in ice and snow, running a marathon without water in the Namib Desert, and being in full-body contact with ice for just under two hours. WHM has three pillars: cold therapy, breathing, and commitment.
Below is a basic summary of the breathing and cold exposure pillars by Jordan Lejuwaan of High Existence:

Breathing
	1. Get comfortable and close your eyes. Sit in a comfortable meditation posture. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without constriction. It is recommended to do this right after waking up since your stomach is still empty.
	2. Warm up. Inhale deeply. Draw the breath in until you feel a slight pressure from inside your chest on your solar plexus. Hold this for a moment and then exhale completely. Push the air out as much as you can. Hold this for a moment. Repeat this warm up 15 times.
	3. 30 power breaths. Imagine you’re blowing up a balloon. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth in short but powerful bursts. The belly is pulled inward when you are breathing out and is pulled outward when you are breathing in. Keep a steady pace and use your midriff fully. Close your eyes and do this around 30 times or until you feel your body is saturated with oxygen. Symptoms could be light-headedness or tingling sensations in the body.
	4. Scan your body. During the 30 power breaths, delve into your body and become aware of it as possible. Trace your awareness up and down your body and use your intuition as to what parts lack energy and what parts are overflowing. Scan for any blockage between the two. Try to send energy/warmth to those blockages. Then release them deeper and deeper. Tremors, traumas and emotional releases can come up. Often people report swirling colors and other visual imagery during this exercise. Get to know this inner world and how it correlates to the feeling of tension or blockages in your body.
	5. The hold. After the the 30 rapid succession of breath cycles, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using too much force. Then push all of the air out and hold for as long as you can. Draw the chin in a bit so as to prevent air from coming in again. Really relax and open all energy channels in your body. Notice how all the oxygen is spreading around in your body. Hold the breath until you experience the gasp reflex on the top of your chest.
	6. Recovery breath. Inhale to full capacity. Feel your chest expanding. Release any tension in the solar plexus. When you are at full capacity, hold the breath once more. Drop the chin to the chest and hold this for around 15 seconds. Notice that you can direct the energy with your awareness. Use this time to scan the body and see where there is no color, tension or blockages. Feel the edges of this tension, go into it, move the energy towards this black hole. Feel the constrictions burning away, the dark places fill with light. Relax the body deeper as you move further inward, let everything go. Your body knows better than you do. After 15 seconds you have completed the first round.
Start this practice with one or two rounds. Try to do it daily and add two more rounds in a few days. After you feel more comfortable with holding your breath you can start to add exercises and stretches. Work up to a minimum of 15 minutes or 6 rounds with exercises. You can do this practice for how long it pleases you.
Cold Exposure
If you are new to cold exposure, begin with cold showers. Try to remain calm, breathe easily, and embrace the cold. According to Wim, small muscles around your veins contract when they sense cold temperatures. After 1-2 weeks of cold exposure, they become stronger and more efficient at allowing blood flow, reducing strain on the heart.
Once cold showers are mastered, transition to ice baths. Begin with 10 minutes and slowly increase the time as you become accustomed to it. On a side note, be aware about using ice baths as a recovery tool after exercising, as it may result in your body relying on ice for recovery and decreasing adaptation after exercise.

Robbie Gonzalez discusses temperature acclimatization in his comprehensive Gizmodo article "How do our bodies adjust to extreme temperatures":

Acclimatization
There is a difference between immediate and long-term physiological responses. Our bodies sweating in response to excessive heat is an immediate response, while adjusting to warmer temperatures so that it sweats earlier and more profusely is a long-term response.
Gonzalez mentions this study that suggests that 10-14 days of heat or cold exposure will allow acclimatization to occur. Another study found that 10 days of cold exposure resulted in the body being better able to generate warmth without shivering and subjects felt more comfortable in the cold and shivered less. (Shivering is caused by repeated muscle tightening and relaxing cycles trying to warm the body [shivering]).
Gonzalez also cites the U.S. Army's "Heat Acclimatization Guide", but I will discuss that after this.
Specific temperature acclimatization varies person-to-person - someone who lives in a hotter environment will acclimatize to his native environment after staying in a non-native (cold) environment than someone just experiencing a new extreme temperature (cold to hot or hot to cold).

The U.S. Army has published a heat acclimatization guide for its Ranger and Airborne school students.

Benefits to heat acclimatization (HA) include:
	• Reduced core temperature.
	• Earlier and more sweating, allowing more dissipation of heat.
	• Earlier skin blood flow, which transfers heat from core to the skin.
	• Lower body heat production.
	• Lower heart rate.
	• Less thirst.
	• Less salt loss via sweat and urine.
	• Improved organ protection.
To become acclimatized to the heat, body temperature needs to be high and sweating needs to occur. Exercise in the desired environment is the best method for HA, whereas resting gives partial, but non-optimal results. On average, about two weeks of daily, two-hour heat exposure with exercise is needed for HA. Aerobic exercise, such as running, is preferable over strength training. The benefits of HA will remain for around one week and reduce by 75% after approximately three weeks after heat exposure stops.
Average athletes require around two weeks for HA, while above-average athletes can require as little as one week for HA. Regardless, both will require living and working in the environment to fully acclimatize.
To actually induce HA, begin by exercising in the cooler part of the day, then slowly add in exercise in the heat as your body allows. Because the process of HA increases sweating (see second bullet point), it is important to compensate via increased fluid intake. Dehydration negates many of already-discussed benefits of HA.

Abnormalities in Pain Tolerance
Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIP), or Congenital Analgesia
A condition where a person has never felt nor can feel physical pain.
Two types of non-responses to pain:
	1. Insensitivity: pain is not perceived.
	2. Indifference: pain is perceived, but they do not react to it.
Causes


Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy (HSAN), or Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy (HSN)
