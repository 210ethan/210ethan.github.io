  Comprehensive ride report from my successful Everesting Base Camp attempt on 16 January 2022.

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>
  The official rules are listed <a href="https://everesting.cc/the-rules/">here</a>, but can be boiled down to a few basic bullet points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Total elevation gain must be at least 29,032 ft (8,849 m).
  </li>
  <li>
    Everesting must be completed in one activity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Everesting must be completed on a single hill, i.e., you must go up and down the same hill <code>CEILING(29,032/[elevation gain of hill in feet])</code> times.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For the Base Camp version, the total elevation gain is half that of Everest, or 4424 m.

<h3 id="preparation_training">Training</h3>

<p>
  My training for this was abysmal. And relative to other cyclists' training for Base Camp/Everesting/10k, it was whatever the superlative of abysmal is. Like <i>really</i> bad.
</p>

<p>
  I first conceived of personally Everesting sometime in late 2020, and based my 2021 training schedule on a late winter attempt. Training started out well. Riding was consistent, I was making obvious progress, and my legs were slowly getting under me. (Side note: my lungs have <i>never</i> been an issue during long efforts. My legs always fail first.)
</p>

<p>
  But at some point in late summer/early fall, I got bored of training on my bikes and training stagnated despite me knowing the attempt was coming up. December rolled around and I was just too busy with life to do a proper attempt.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of actual cycling (which is the best prep one can do, don't let anyone say otherwise), my leg work over the past few months has exclusively been rear-foot-elevated split squats and single-leg Romanian deadlifts. Rep ranges for each were 3-5x4-8x100-140 and 3x5-8x100-120, respectively and total weight added.
</p>

<p>
  And that's pretty much it. Happy to provide specific training sessions over the year, just <a href="../about/about.html#contact">contact me</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="preparation_stuff">Stuff</h3>

<p>
  I expected the morning weather to be pretty brutal (temperature of 34 °F / 1 °C and winds of 10 mph / 16 kph). Using "be bold, go cold" adage I've abided by my entire life, I was rocking:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cycling shoes
  </li>
  <li>
    Swiftwick socks
  </li>
  <li>
    Cycling shorts (padded, not too tight)
  </li>
  <li>
    Windbreaking pants
  </li>
  <li>
    My favorite shirt of all-time
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/121971">Base layer</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    nonprophet hoodie
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My favorite shirt, the shorts, and socks stayed on the entire time and were never replaced.
</p>

<p>
  Food was pretty straightforward and was kindly supplemented mid-ride with some Clif Kids Z Bars:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Clif Builder Bars (chocolate mint)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bananas
  </li>
  <li>
    Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
  </li>
  <li>
    Nuun tablets (caffeine included)
  </li>
  <li>
    Clif Kids Z Bars
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My phone battery is notoriously unreliable (or maybe I'm just bad at keeping it charged, but let's go with the former), so I brought enough portable chargers to power my phone until the end of time:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z9QVE4Q">Anker PowerCore 13000</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Technology-High-Capacity-Compatible/dp/B07S829LBX/">Anker PowerCore 20000</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Mophie 6040 mAh
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My phone was mounted to my handlebars for easy access/listening and the portable charger that was in use was in the bike's pouch (mounted between the top tube and down tube).
</p>

<h3 id="preparation">Bike</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.ibiscycles.com/bikes/ripley">Ripley's</a> tires were pressurized to 35 psi and suspension locked out.

<p>
  And boy, did I get punched in the kisser.
</p>

<p>
  Morning of I was up at 3:30am to load the car and get on the road. I got dropped off and began the effort around 4:40am in the dead of morning. Nobody was around: I didn't see car headlights or hear anything person-related until 7:00-7:30am-ish. It was just me for those couple of hours.
