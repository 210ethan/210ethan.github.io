<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Some endurance efforts I've attempted, completed, or plan to attempt involve eventual sleep deprivation in the later stages of the effort. My <a href="everesting2.html">second Everesting attempt</a> had me burning the midnight oil. My first go at <a href="races.html#2022_24_hours_canyon">24 Hours in the Canyon</a> had me riding in the dead of night. Some of the mountains I want to summit in a single push will require no sleep for many, many hours while still maintaining mental focus and physical effort.
</p>

<p>
  Learning how to deal with and be comfortable with lack of sleep for an extended period of time is important for the competitive edge it provides. While others are getting the precious sleep they require, the trainee who spent the time depriving themselves earlier is now gaining a lead with every pedal stroke, every foot strike, every breath.
</p>

<p>
  Like the "sweat in training to prevent bleeding in war" quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  He who trains without sleep will be able to compete with sleep.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The importance of attempting to train this has been established, but can it really be trained? The literature should give us a clue, while the experiments will provide personalized results.
