<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Some endurance efforts I've attempted, completed, or plan to attempt involve eventual sleep deprivation in the later stages of the effort. My <a href="everesting2.html">second Everesting attempt</a> had me burning the midnight oil. My first go at <a href="races.html#2022_24_hours_canyon">24 Hours in the Canyon</a> had me riding in the dead of night. Some of the mountains I want to summit in a single push will require no sleep for many, many hours while still maintaining mental focus and physical effort.
</p>

<p>
  Learning how to deal with and be comfortable with lack of sleep for an extended period of time is important for the competitive edge it provides. While others are getting the precious sleep they require, the trainee who spent the time depriving themselves earlier is now gaining a lead with every pedal stroke, every foot strike, every breath.
</p>

<p>
  Like the "sweat in training to prevent bleeding in war" quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  He who trains without sleep will be able to compete with sleep.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The importance of attempting to train this has been established, but can it really be trained? The literature should give us a clue, while the experiments will provide personalized results.

  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chiara-Gattoni">Chiara Gattoni</a> appears to be the most prolific researcher in the sleep deprivation-endurance performance field. Her thesis, <a href="https://github.com/210ethan/210ethan.github.io/blob/master/training/media/sleepdeprivation/Mental%20Fatigue%20and%20Sleep%20Deprivation%20Effects%2C%20Mechanisms%2C%20and%20Countermeasures%20in%20Endurance%20Exercise%20Performance.pdf">Mental Fatigue and Sleep Deprivation: Effects, Mechanisms, and Countermeasures in Endurance Exercise Performance</a>, offers an abundance of information on the subject through theory and publications. Chapters include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sleep Deprivation: Effects, Mechanisms and Countermeasures
  </li>
  <li>
    The Effects of One-Night Sleep Deprivation and One-Night Recovery Sleep on Endurance Cycling Performance
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep Deprivation Training to Reduce the Negative Effects of Sleep Restriction on Endurance Exercise Performance: a Single Case Study
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of the above will be reviewed for both information and experimental methods.

<h3>The Effects of One-Night Sleep Deprivation and One-Night Recovery Sleep on Endurance Cycling Performance</h3>

<blockquote>
  The official definitions of mental fatigue and sleepiness are discrete and they do not overlap. Indeed, although they both contribute to performance impairments, sleepiness entails sleep deprivation/lack of sleep, whereas mental fatigue implies effort (Ackerman, 2011) .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns, 1991) and the Sleep Wake Activity Inventory (Rosenthal et al., 1993) are the most used ones, measuring subjective sleep propensity and multidimensional aspects of sleepiness, respectively.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Sleep deprivation results in overall mood and emotional functioning changes, such as increased levels of subjective fatigue, sleepiness, confusion, stress and depression (Dinges et al., 1997) which are associated with decreased levels of vigour (Martin et al., 1986; Meney et al., 1998) and liveliness (Scott et al., 2006; Skein et al., 2011). [It is easy to see why getting used to sleep deprivation is important before the "big day"â€”experiencing fatigue, confusion, stress, and depression for the first time under stressful conditions can destroy a person.]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  no effects have been shown on modified decision making Stroop task performance during 96-125 h of adventure racing following 100 hours of sleep deprivation (Lucas et al., 2009) [This seems wrong to me.]
</blockquote>
