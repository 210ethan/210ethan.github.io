<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Some endurance efforts I've attempted, completed, or plan to attempt involve eventual sleep deprivation in the later stages of the effort. My <a href="everesting2.html">second Everesting attempt</a> had me burning the midnight oil. My first go at <a href="races.html#2022_24_hours_canyon">24 Hours in the Canyon</a> had me riding in the dead of night. Some of the mountains I want to summit in a single push will require no sleep for many, many hours while still maintaining mental focus and physical effort.
</p>

<p>
  Learning how to deal with and be comfortable with lack of sleep for an extended period of time is important for the competitive edge it provides. While others are getting the precious sleep they require, the trainee who spent the time depriving themselves earlier is now gaining a lead with every pedal stroke, every foot strike, every breath.
</p>

<p>
  Like the "sweat in training to prevent bleeding in war" quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  He who trains without sleep will be able to compete with sleep.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The importance of attempting to train this has been established, but can it really be trained? The literature should give us a clue, while the experiments will provide personalized results.

  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chiara-Gattoni">Chiara Gattoni</a> appears to be the most prolific researcher in the sleep deprivation-endurance performance field. Her thesis, <a href="https://github.com/210ethan/210ethan.github.io/blob/master/training/media/sleepdeprivation/Mental%20Fatigue%20and%20Sleep%20Deprivation%20Effects%2C%20Mechanisms%2C%20and%20Countermeasures%20in%20Endurance%20Exercise%20Performance.pdf">Mental Fatigue and Sleep Deprivation: Effects, Mechanisms, and Countermeasures in Endurance Exercise Performance</a>, offers an abundance of information on the subject through theory and publications. Chapters include:
</p>

  <li>

  Each of the above will be reviewed for both information and experimental methods.

<h3>Sleep Deprivation: Effects, Mechanisms and Countermeasures</h3>

<blockquote>
  The official definitions of mental fatigue and sleepiness are discrete and they do not overlap. Indeed, although they both contribute to performance impairments, sleepiness entails sleep deprivation/lack of sleep, whereas mental fatigue implies effort (Ackerman, 2011) .
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns, 1991) and the Sleep Wake Activity Inventory (Rosenthal et al., 1993) are the most used ones, measuring subjective sleep propensity and multidimensional aspects of sleepiness, respectively.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Sleep deprivation results in overall mood and emotional functioning changes, such as increased levels of subjective fatigue, sleepiness, confusion, stress and depression (Dinges et al., 1997) which are associated with decreased levels of vigour (Martin et al., 1986; Meney et al., 1998) and liveliness (Scott et al., 2006; Skein et al., 2011).
</blockquote>

<p>
  It is easy to see why getting used to sleep deprivation is important before the "big day"â€”experiencing fatigue, confusion, stress, and depression for the first time under stressful conditions can destroy a person.
</p>

<blockquote>
  no effects have been shown on modified decision making Stroop task performance during 96-125 h of adventure racing following 100 hours of sleep deprivation (<a href="https://github.com/210ethan/210ethan.github.io/blob/master/training/media/sleepdeprivation/The%20impact%20of%20100%20hours%20of%20exercise%20and%20sleep%20deprivation%20on%20cognitive%20function%20and%20physical%20capacities.pdf">Lucas et al., 2009</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
  This seems wrong to me, so I looked at the study (Lucas 2009, linked above) and it appears Gattoni misinterpreted the results of "Complex response times were affected by the race (16% slower), although not significantly so (P = 0.18) (side note: what kind of p-value is that?!), and were dependent on exercise intensity (less so at 50% peak power output after racing)." I'm also curious about the mechanism of leg and arm strength decreasing a mere 17% and 11% after 96-125 hours of racing. Different fibers being recruited was my initial thought, but strength endurance was minimally affected as well. The stated "within 3 h" recovery period is a bit longer than I would have expected and may contribute to the surprising lack of strength loss.
</p>

<p>
  (Lucas 2009) brings up another good point that will be touched on later (emphasis the entire paragraph):
</p>

<blockquote>
  This hypothesis [Dinges 1992] predicts that the greater the physiological sleepiness brought on by sleep loss, the more dependent the brain becomes on the local environment to maintain wakefulness and the more vulnerable it becomes to environmental monotony. Motivation and incentive can contribute to, or override, this environmental effect, but for a limited time (Dinges, 1992).
</blockquote>

<p>
  Gattoni discusses the conflicting results of different sleep <i>restriction</i> studies on the performance of athletes:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Regarding sleep restriction, it has been found that one partially disrupted night of sleep (i.e. 3 h of sleep restriction) does not affect the performance of 7 cyclists during an incremental cycling test to exhaustion (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1748108/">Mougin et al., 1991</a>) . The same results have been shown by (Reilly & Deykin, 1983), who have seen no impairments in 8 trained subjects during an incremental running test until exhaustion following three nights of sleep restriction, and by (Mejri et al., 2014), who have found no differences in the total distance covered during a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (level one) in 10 Taekwondo players following partial sleep recovery. By contrast, it has been demonstrated that two nights of sleep restriction significantly impair the maximal work rate during a similar incremental cycling test protocol until exhaustion as the one used by Mougin and colleagues (Mougin et al., 2001).
</blockquote>

<p>
  She then concedes as to the dubiousness of these studies:
</p>

<blockquote>
  these results might be due to the relatively small sample sizes used, which might have contributed to reach not enough statistical power, and/or to a substantial variability on the effects of lack of sleep among the subjects tested
</blockquote>

<p>
  The sample sizes of seven, eight, and 10 are extremely low for my liking. The <a href="https://www.scienceforsport.com/yo-yo-intermittent-recovery-test-level-1/">YYIR</a> also focuses on aerobic fitness through high-intensity work, rather than long, slow efforts. I'm not sure how representative this is.
</p>

<p>
  The effects of sleep <i>deprivation</i> are fairly straightforward for longer efforts:
</p>

<blockquote>
  36 h and 50 h of sleep deprivation impairs endurance exercise tolerance by 11% (Martin, 1981) and 20% respectively (Martin & Chen, 1984)
</blockquote>

<h3>The Effects of One-Night Sleep Deprivation and One-Night Recovery Sleep on Endurance Cycling Performance</h3>

<p>
  The rest of this section goes over neurobiological mechanisms of sleep deprivation, countermeasures (discussed <a href="">here [FINISH]</a>), and a summary of what was discussed.
