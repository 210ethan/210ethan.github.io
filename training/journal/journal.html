<h2 id="november_2020">November 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    1: Adding a lateral glute raise to my warm-ups per a friend's recommendation and lunges to strength training. [!injury]
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="october_2020">October 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    31: Long and hot showers do not work on my body. They feel good in the moment, but after I get out I feel weak-ish. No more of these. [!recovery]
  </li>
  <li>
    30: Seems like the <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/mens-running-shoes-launch-6/110297.html">Brooks Launch 6</a> seems like a good shoe for me. The <a href="https://www.saucony.com/en/kinvara-11/43070M.html">Saucony Kinvara 11</a>'s heel-toe drop is likely too small for me. Will continue with these for a few more months and maybe try something in between depending on the results. [!running, !injury]
  </li>
  <li>
    29: Often times when my back hurts after straining it I just need to get moving and warm for it to go away. I will begin to add a 10 minute walk to the middle of my day. [!injury]
  </li>
  <li>
    29: I tend to rush through training sessions, which could be a reason for injuries. From now on, I will take at least 15 minutes for warming up: stretching, light weights (barbell complex, etc), and other drills. This requires that I 1) wake up earlier, or 2) cut down on total volume. I'll choose the former. [!injury]
  </li>
  <li>
    28: Realized one possible cause of my newfound (as in I've never had lower back issues from years of squatting heavy (heavy for me)) back issues is my 1) sitting, and 2) decreased hamstring flexibility. I've read a few people's accounts and they often attribute it to their hamstrings pulling too much. I have restarted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stand-up-the-work-break-timer/id828244687">Stand Up!</a> app and will begin regular stretching in the evening before bed. [!injury, !flexibility]
  </li>
  <li>
    23/24: Strained my lower back rowing, then pushed it while lifting. I was attempting to rock forward more on the recovery/catch, but at the expense of low back rounding. Strength work was okay (used a belt for everything), but still shouldn't have pushed it. Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6_AvZ2Fh4Y">this video</a> proposing to sit on the anterior part of your hips (or more forward towards your hamstrings/front). I rowed a few sets of 250-500m using this technique and I don't feel anything (a good thing). Rehab will be McGill Big 3-5, stretching, and rest (no exercise + sleep). [!recovery, !injury]
  </li>
  <li>
    17: Seemed to have finally fixed my right shoulder's impingement from September 2019's bike crash. I was doing shoulder opening using a racked barbell and felt a muscle/tissue/tendon (not really sure) seem to "slip" across my shoulder bone. Before this happening, ROM felt blocked by something. I did a few more shoulder opening tests and it feels better. Will take it slow and work on overhead stabilization before getting back into more overhead mobility. [!injury]
  </li>
</ul>
