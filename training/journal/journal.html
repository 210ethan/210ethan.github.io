<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<p>
  I use <a href="http://www.tacticalbarbell.com/">Tactical Barbell</a> for strength and <a href="https://www.thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab's Year of the Engine</a> for conditioning.
</p>

<p>
  My weekly schedule looks like:
</p>

<img src="media/weekly_schedule.png" alt="weekly_schedule" class="center">

<p>
  With focuses being separated by month:
</p>

<img src="media/month_focus.png" alt="month_focus" class="center">

<p>
  Putting all this together using January and April as examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    January:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Strength (3x/week): FS, OHP, CU
      </li>
      <li>
        Conditioning (5x/week): 3x Airdyne, 1x running, 1x rowing
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessory/strength maintenance (1x/week): D, SU
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        Strength (3x/week): FS, D, CU
      </li>
      <li>
        Conditioning (5x/week): 3x rowing, 1x running, 1x Airdyne
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessory/strength maintenance (1x/week): OHP, SU, R
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specifics">Specifics</h3>

<h4 id="warm_up">Warm Up</h4>

<p>
  Strength warm up lasts at least 20 minutes and consists of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Stretching: hamstring, glute, groin, hip flexor, lat, tricep, shoulders, squat (20-30s each)
  </li>
  <li>
    Prehab: curl-up, side plank, bird-dog, glute bridge (3x10s)
  </li>
  <li>
    Barbell complex: squats (front, back, overhead), presses (strict, push), rows, RDL
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Conditioning warm up lasts 5-10 minutes and consists of the primary activity for that amount of time, e.g., easy spinning on the Airdyne for 5-10 minutes before the actual hard work starts.
</p>

<h4 id="strength">Strength</h4>

<p>
  All strength movements follow a similar <a href="https://www.crossfitcityline.com/educational-articles/2016/3/14/tempo-training-how-a-few-se">tempo</a> of (1-3)(1-2)X(0-2):
</p>

<p>
  Rest times are at least 2 minutes, but generally never more than 3 (due to time constraints).
</p>

<p>
  I am and will continue to be conservative with weight increases. I increase my training max (which working sets are calculated from) by 2.5-5 lb (depending on the lift and success in the past training block) every 6 weeks. If I didn't make all working sets or struggled with some, I maintain that same weight for at least the next 3 weeks.
</p>

<p>
  Primary exercises are all full ROM, no exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    FS: I use Adidas Powerlift 2 in addition to a small wedge underneath the heel. This gives me about 1.2 in. (3.0 cm) in heel elevation and allows me to stay upright. I choose FS over BS because there's less stress on the lower back.
  </li>
  <li>
    OHP: I follow similar form to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnBmiBqp-AI">Rippetoe's tutorial</a>, except the grip. My forearms are vertical at the bottom and elbows go out to roughly 45° during the press. I choose OHP/D over bench because OHP is full-body.
  </li>
  <li>
    CU: I do one "swing" at the bottom and then pull. This is around 2 seconds of hang time. I chooese CU over PU because they feel more natural.
  </li>
  <li>
    D: I do one "swing" at the top and then dip. This is around 2 seconds of support time. I choose D because I just like doing weighted dips.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Supplementary exercises:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    SU: These will be done on a 20 in. box and on one leg at a time, i.e., right leg steps up and lowers. I chose these in preparation for my summiting of a few mountains in 2021.
  </li>
  <li>
    R: Not sure how these will be done yet, but good exercise for retraction strength.
  </li>
  <li>
    OHS: Good for core stability and shoulder strength.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recovery">Recovery</h4>

<p>
  From Mark Twight's original Gym Jones <a href="https://www.tdlccycling.com/no-longer-gym-jones-certified-instructor/">philosophy</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Recovery is more than 50% of the process.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I view recovery in three distinct, but related, aspects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Diet: Eat a lot of high-quality food in this order: meats/vegetables, fruits/nuts, processed, junk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep: Get as much high-quality sleep as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Active: Activities to get the blood flowing without stressing any system. Includes walking, foam rolling, stretching, massages, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  How I apply these principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Diet:
    <ul>
      <li>
        I eat a fair amount of high-quality food.
      </li>
      <li>
        I only drink water (sparkling and regular), tea, and almond milk. I rarely drink alcohol, but when I do it's either beer or vodka and water. I do not drink coffee or soft drinks.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do not count calories religiously, but have a fair idea of how much I've eaten throughout the day.
      </li>
      <li>
        I take 5 g of <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bodybuilding-com/signature-creatine-monohydrate.html?skuId=BBCOM5100081">creatine monohydrate</a> daily.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep:
    <ul>
      <li>
        I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M8IAUC3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">red light bulbs</a> in my room before I go to bed.
      </li>
      <li>
        I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CS31NDE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">blackout curtains</a> that make my room extremely dark (although there some light slips in the side).
      </li>
      <li>
        I rarely eat within a few hours of bed.
      </li>
      <li>
        I go to bed around the same time every night.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do not drink caffeine and rarely drink alcohol.
      </li>
      <li>
        See more sleep suggestions <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25454674/">here</a> (sleep hygiene literature review) and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053484/">here</a> (naps).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Active:
    <ul>
      <li>
        My job is fairly active, requiring me to walk and move around regularly. I also use a standing desk.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend 5-10 minutes every night stretching and foam rolling.
      </li>
      <li>
        I enjoy going on walks during my off days with friends.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

<p>
  I will give monthly updates on how training is going, as well as any modifications I've made. I predict that if I follow all recovery protocols I've put in place (diet, sleep, active recovery), I will make decent progress across all exercises in both strength and conditioning. If I feel like my progress is suffering, I will do the following (in order):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Begin to track my calories and attempt to eat more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decrease the number of strength working sets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decrease strength work frequency to twice per week.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="november_2020">November 2020</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    28: Volume will be substantially increased since I've added <a href="https://www.thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a> five times per week. [!conditioning, !events]
  </li>
  <li>
    28: It seems like no matter what hinging movement I do, my lower back gets strained. I will start low and stick with a single hinge movement (KBS) for the month of December and see how my back responds. [!injury_prevention]
  </li>
  <li>
    3: I've been slowing down my eccentrics on FS and CU and feels great. Will continue to do this instead of the almost-dive-bombing I used to do. [!strength]
  </li>
  <li>
    1: Adding a lateral glute raise to my warm-ups per a friend's recommendation and lunges to strength training. [!injury_prevention]
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="october_2020">October 2020</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    31: Long and hot showers do not work on my body. They feel good in the moment, but after I get out I feel weak-ish. No more of these. [!recovery]
  </li>
  <li>
    30: <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/mens-running-shoes-launch-6/110297.html">Brooks Launch 6</a> seems like a good shoe for me. The <a href="https://www.saucony.com/en/kinvara-11/43070M.html">Saucony Kinvara 11</a>'s heel-toe drop is likely too small for me. Will continue with these for a few more months and maybe try something in between depending on the results. [!running, !injury_prevention]
  </li>
  <li>
    29: Often times when my back hurts after straining it I just need to get moving and warm for it to go away. I will begin to add a 10 minute walk to the middle of my day. [!injury_prevention]
  </li>
  <li>
    29: I tend to rush through training sessions, which could be a reason for injuries. From now on, I will take at least 15 minutes for warming up: stretching, light weights (barbell complex, etc), and other drills. This requires that I 1) wake up earlier, or 2) cut down on total volume. I'll choose the former. [!injury_prevention]
  </li>
  <li>
    28: Realized one possible cause of my newfound (as in I've never had lower back issues from years of squatting heavy (heavy for me)) back issues is my 1) sitting, and 2) decreased hamstring flexibility. I've read a few people's accounts and they often attribute it to their hamstrings pulling too much. I have restarted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stand-up-the-work-break-timer/id828244687">Stand Up!</a> app and will begin regular stretching in the evening before bed. [!injury_prevention, !flexibility]
  </li>
  <li>
    23/24: Strained my lower back rowing, then pushed it while lifting. I was attempting to rock forward more on the recovery/catch, but at the expense of low back rounding. Strength work was okay (used a belt for everything), but still shouldn't have pushed it. Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6_AvZ2Fh4Y">this video</a> proposing to sit on the anterior part of your hips (or more forward towards your hamstrings/front). I rowed a few sets of 250-500m using this technique and I don't feel anything (a good thing). Rehab will be McGill Big 3-5, stretching, and rest (no exercise + sleep). [!recovery, !injury_prevention]
  </li>
  <li>
    17: Seemed to have finally fixed my right shoulder's impingement from September 2019's bike crash. I was doing shoulder opening using a racked barbell and felt a muscle/tissue/tendon (not really sure) seem to "slip" across my shoulder bone. Before this happening, ROM felt blocked by something. I did a few more shoulder opening tests and it feels better. Will take it slow and work on overhead stabilization before getting back into more overhead mobility. [!injury_prevention]
  </li>

<h2 id="ongoing_issues">Ongoing Issues</h2>

<h3 id="shins">Shin Splints</h3>

<h4>Cause</h4>

<p>
  I have been a mid- to forefoot striker since age 14. This posed no issues until age 16, when I began to develop shin problems. I was diagnosed with stress reactions (a degree below stress fractures) and <a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/compartment-syndrome/">compartment syndrome</a>, defined as:
</p>

<blockquote>
  occurs when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels. This pressure can decrease blood flow, which prevents nourishment and oxygen from reaching nerve and muscle cells.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The angle at which I <i>used</i> to strike was too far in front of body, causing major impact issues.
</p>

<h4>Current Fixes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Increasing cadence: I now run around 170 spm, which allows my feet to land directly underneath my mass. This seems to help.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changing surfaces: I used to run technical trails, but this seems to aggravate my shin/ankle with the constant awkward positioning. I now run primarily on grass or pavement, but sometimes trails.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shoes: I run in the <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/mens-running-shoes-launch-6/110297.html">Brooks Launch 6</a> (midsole drop = 10 mm). I tried the <a href="https://www.saucony.com/en/kinvara-11/43070M.html">Saucony Kinvara 11</a> (offset = 4 mm), but this increased shin issues. Will continue with these for a few more months and maybe try a dedicated trail running shoe in between depending on the results.
  </li>
  <li>
    Foam rolling: This is not as consistent as it should be, but single-leg foam rolling three sides of my calf/lower leg: outside, center, inside.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/gq0xvv/running_form_causing_posterior_tibial_pain/">r/AdvancedRunning</a> post here.
</p>

<h3 id="lower_back">Lower Back</h3>

<h4>Cause</h4>

<p>
  On 30 May 2020, I was back squatting with 205 lb. I strained a muscle in my right lower back, but continued to lift (one set of BS, two heavy-ish sets of DL). My back has not felt the same since. [FINISH]
</p>

<h4>Current Solutions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_e4I-brfqs">McGill Big 3</a>: These three exercises—curl-up, side plank, and bird dog—help to warm up my core for lifting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Elevating heels: I purchased Adidas Powerlift 2 (0.6 in. heel) and further elevate them with another ~0.5 in. mat. This allows my back to remain very upright during squatting. Otherwise, I would have to lean forward to maintain balance at the expense of my back.
  </li>
  <li>
    Belt: I purchased a <a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-echo-lifting-belt">Rogue Echo Belt</a>. It helps with bracing and core support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Front squat: I switched to front squat, which decreases spinal compression and overall lower back stress. However, this is an issue when trying to overload the legs, as the thoracic back is the limiting factor, not the legs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleeping position: I used to sleep on my stomach, which caused my back to be in constant extension throughout the night. Now I sleep on my back or side.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rowing form: [TBD]
  </li>
  <li>
    Hamstring stretching: [TBD]
  </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="it_band">IT Band</h3>

<h4>Cause</h4>



<h4>Current Solutions</h4>








<hr>

<h2 id="former_issues">Former Issues</h2>

<h3 id="shoulder">Shoulder</h3>

<h4>Cause</h4>

<p>
  In September 2019, I went off of a 2-ft drop on my bike. I landed off-camber and landed on my right shoulder on the grass. My shoulder hurt for a few weeks and I immediately lost my normal overhead mobility (180° open shoulders). I went to a sports medicine doctor, got an X-ray, and he determined it was an impingement. I did some exercises (not as religiously as I should have), but it never got better. It always felt like something was blocking the last 10-20° for completely open shoulders (180° from hands to waist).
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>
  On 2X October 2020, I was doing overhead squats or shoulder opening (can't remember which), and felt a tissue "slide" across my bone. This immediately fixed the mobility issue.
