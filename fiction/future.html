<p>
  Yet another solitary Saturday night spent staring at the multiple monitors propped up on the desk amongst crushed Monster cans, empty Doritos bags, and a tangle of wires. The ever-changing colors illuminated Ivan's dreary face, highlighting the heavy bags underneath his eyes that proved how little sleep he got and how little he cared about the fact. The headphones prevented any noise from getting out and the blackout curtains kept both prying eyes and unwanted light out, isolating him from his neighbors and society.
</p>

<p>
  A conglomeration of windows were open: a YouTube video covering the so-called epidemic of 3D-printed guns in Europe and a companion tab with the drawings for printing one; a blog post explaining how to spot a good fake ID; a forum post detailing the military's use of lasers at sea; a Twitch stream of Apex Legends. Ivan's eyes flickered back and forth consuming each with fervor and hunger, his fingers typed frantically to fact-check claims and learn more about the subject at hand. Occasional sips were taken from the last Monster can while pages were loading, minimizing "unproductive" time.
</p>

<p>
  Ivan was used to speeding up videos to prevent wasting his precious time; they were often too slow, and speeding them up to one-and-a-half times speed minimized time spent watching without losing comprehension. A one-and-a-half times increase was his standard, initiated by pressing the 'g' key, but slower speeds could be used for more complex videos and faster speeds for simpler. The current speed was shown by a slightly transparent box in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. The YouTube video finished and the next video in the queue began to play. Deep into learning about the melt rates of various materials based on range and power, Ivan pressed 'g' on the YouTube tab, increasing the speed at which he watched, or at least half-listened to, an interview between one of his favorite actors and a talk show host.

<p>
  But the jokes and questions quickly went in one ear and out the other, as did the tens of subsequent videos that next in the queue. But Ivan didn't notice, the lasers post was too interesting, too engrossing for him to pay attention to anything else. The fake ID page sat unlooked at, the stream continued on, the streamer not caring nor knowing that one of his thousands of viewers was paying no attention to his jokes and gameplay. A couple of hours and academic papers later, Ivan had devoured enough on lasers for the night and was ready to call it quits. He closed the long-forgotten fake ID post, pressed the back button on the YouTube tab until the video after the European guns came up, and paused momentarily on the Twitch stream to watch the final battle between squads. Man, those guys are quick, though Ivan. I really gotta play on higher sensitivities.

  Coincidentally, the streamer announced the end of his night, as it was <i>way</i> past his bedtime and he had another long day of "work'" starting at 10:00am, which was only six hours away! Ivan chuckled at the thought of having to be up that early as he closed the tab and turned off the monitorâ€”getting eight hours was barely enough sleep for him. He hesitated as the math calculated in his head and he realized something didn't add up. It was about 4:00am for the streamer, but only 2:30am for him. Timezones only changed in multiples of hours, never half-hours. Ivan quickly turned his computer back on and opened the recently-deleted tab, but the stream was shut down and a replay was only available to paying subscribers, something Ivan was not. Ivan explained away the discrepancy as a simple miscalculation by the sleep-starved streamer, and thought of it no more as he collapsed onto his unmade bed and fell into a deep slumber.

  Sunday was as uneventful as Saturday, save for the impending doom of the start of the workweek that was less than 24 hours away. But the evening was almost identical. Dinner was had and the Aeron occupied as Ivan hunkered down for another long night of multitasking: same shit, different day. This time the focus was on the trove of Wikipedia articles he had bookmarked for later reading, but the other staples of a fun evening were still there. YouTube consisted of music remixes and the stream a newly-released game that was making its rounds amongst the top creators. And just like Saturday, Ivan ended it with closing the tens of tabs and watching the stream until a stopping point was reached. This time Ivan noticed the time on the streamer's desktop, who Ivan knew for a fact was based on the east coast. It read 1:27am. Ivan verified the time on his computer, but it they didn't match: his read 11:42pm. Something was wrong. Ivan was on the east coast, too. Same timezone means same time, no matter the latitude or longitude or altitude. Ivan checked his phone: 11:42pm. Ivan googled the time: 11:42pm. And yet the streamer's clock continued to read almost an hour-and-a-half ahead. Windows time didn't just read wrong like that. Ivan scoured the screen for some other confirmation of the time, but only noticed the quiet "1.5x" box on the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Ivan's eyes grew wide as he quickly unmuted the stream and focused on the gameplay. The audio was garbled as it entered his ears, almost like it was sped up or the streamer was trying to speak fast. The gameplay looked equally as unnaturally fast. Ivan's hands trembled as he pressed the 'd' key fives times, each of which increased the speed by 0.1x. The box now read "2.0x" and the difference was stark. He could barely understand his native English and the character was flying through the village, interacting with others faster than would be possible or even enjoyable. The true test would be done with his phone's timer, an infallible instrument that could be compared against the streamer's equally-as-infallible Windows clock.
</p>

<p>
  The top of the minute hit and Ivan started the timer. The seconds passed slowly as Ivan's finger gently shook over the "Stop" button, his eyes locked on to the time. After what felt like 30 seconds the clock read 1:30am, a full minute after the timer was started. The phone timer was promptly stopped, reading what was to be Ivan's saving grace: 30.32 seconds. 30 seconds had passed in Ivan time, but a full minute had passed in stream time. Ivan was looking almost two hours into the future.
