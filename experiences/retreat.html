<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>

<p>
  After having a nice lunch in downtown Berkeley with a local family member, I was dropped off at my lodging, eager to meet the other early-comers. I first met SP in the garden area, hitting it off with some jokes and discussion of books. We sent out an open lunch invitation to the wider group and got two stragglers just arriving: PL and SB. We make the 0.5 mi walk to Humbowl, a "health food restaurant" off College Ave. Delicious food! There we met up with SS. Conversation jumped around before we headed back to the hotel to meet others and continue settling in.
</p>

<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>

<p>
  Friday was a very structured day with all attendees attending identical sessions led by different people (i.e., group X went to the purpose session led by A and group Y went to the purpse session led by B). Each session lasted around an hour with a 5-10-minute grace period between to allow for overflowing conversations and general mingling around the snacks.
</p>

<p>
  The day kicked off with "Defining the purpose of your community"

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>
  Each thought is split up into an actual thought and some possible actions I may or may not take.
</p>

<h3 id="scenes">Scenes</h3>

<p>
  One of, if not the, biggest takeaways I got was from the idea of "scenes". TC brought this up as it related to both his and others' experiences in music: the Roots started out just jamming together and eventually made a record label, while TC's friends and bandmates would hang together in the same areas/venues, working on different projects, bouncing ideas off of each others, and helping each other out as needed. I'm a bit disappointed I didn't make this connection earlier considering what I'm trying to do with my <a href="https://210ethan.github.io/training/dallas.html">training partner ad</a> and emulating Gym Jones initial success and reputation.
</p>

<p>
  This is how revolutionary ideas are formed. This is how things get done. This is how progress is made.
</p>

<p>
  A few examples of scenes that were brought up (note there is a common thread, a shared interest within each scene):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_project">Manhattan Project</a>: Employed some of the smartest scientists in the world, including Feynman, Fermi, Teller, von Neumann, and Szilard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gym Jones: Brought together some of the best athletes from a variety of disciplines, including fighting, climbing, and cycling, into a single space. Athletes were ultra-competitive and worked harder due to the peer pressure of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/business-financing/startup-incubator">Incubators</a>:
    <blockquote>
      A startup incubator is a collaborative program for startup companies — usually physically located in one central workspace — designed to help startups in their infancy succeed by providing workspace, seed funding, mentoring and training.
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Central">Café Central</a>: A Viennese café that served as a meeting point for intellectuals, such as Adler, Trotsky, and later Freud, Stalin, and Lenin.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States">Founding Fathers</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Qualities of the group include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Positive in-group competition: This is the only way to get substantially better at something. Competition is required and should be encouraged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shared values: As mentioned, there is something common holding the scene together, even if interests are slightly different. For Gym Jones it was sport, for incubators it's the desire to make it, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Rising tide raises all ships": Everyone will benefit from the scene, albeit some more than others. Scenes are non-zero sum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Desirable: Others should want to join the scene whether due to its exclusivity, the content/people it produces, or the benefits offered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Access to tacit knowledge and mentorship: Some scene members are preferably experts or significantly experienced in their fields and can provide a wealth of knowledge to the less experienced.
  </li>
  <LI>
    Willing to donate time and energy: The potential results must be worth someone wanting to donate their time and energy towards improving the scene.
  </LI>
</ul>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p>
  Making our meetup group more of a scene has become a priority for me. I'll attempt to get people to be more open about their interests and engage with them to some degree based on my interest in the topic.
</p>

<h3 id="people">People</h3>

<p>
  There are so many interesting people out there. Some topics of discussion/things people there were working on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Why is the labor participation rate 60%? What are the 100 million people that aren't participating doing? How can we engage them and harness the potential?
  </li>
  <li>
    Deliberate practice, hard first practice, and what it takes to progress in skill-based activities
  </li>
  <li>
    The future of self-driving cars and considerations that aren't often taken into account
  </li>
  <li>
    Ways to attack economic inefficiencies, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920">Jones Act</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgism</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The differences in communication norms and ability between generations
  </li>
  <li>
    Translation strengths of various Russian-English translators
  </li>
  <li>
    American Sign Language and its nuances
  </li>
  <li>
    Economics, the production of money, and the current state of the U.S. economy
  </li>
  <li>
    Russia-Ukraine war
  </li>
  <li>
    AI safety (who would've guessed)
  </li>
  <li>
    Spaced repetition
  </li>
  <li>
    Accountability and one-on-ones
  </li>
  <li>
    Sushi (at a depth much, much greater than I've ever had or heard)
  </li>
  <li>
    Christopher Alexander's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language"><i>A Pattern Language</i></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Attracting non-fit people to fitness
  </li>
  <li>
    Metascience
  </li>
  <li>
    Kidney stone reduction as an EA cause
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p>
  There are two options to meeting more interesting people through this group:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Continue to grow without any direction, leading to 1:x ratio of interesting:not interesting
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on "recruiting" from interesting sources
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  While the two aren't mutually exclusive, they both require effort (the latter more than the former), so it should be concentrated on targeted recruiting. Where this will be done I do not know.
</p>

<p>
  But maintenance of the friendships (I'd argue they are genuine friendships despite the short duration) must also be considered. As usual, quality trumps quantity of friendship, so I'll focus on keeping up with a few select people I really got along with and see myself keeping up with. This list includes JE, JS, SA, TC, and WD. Keeping up isn't always phone calls, but can be a simple message, thought, or link, so long as it somewhat relates.
