<p>
  Each thought is split up into an actual thought and some possible actions I may or may not take.

<h3 id="scenes">Scenes</h3>

<p>
  One of, if not the, biggest takeaways I got was from the idea of "scenes". TNC brought this up as it related to both his and others' experiences in music: the Roots started out just jamming together and eventually made a record label, while TNC's friends and bandmates would hang together in the same areas/venues, working on different projects, bouncing ideas off of each others, and helping each other out as needed. I'm a bit disappointed I didn't make this connection earlier considering what I'm trying to do with my <a href="https://210ethan.github.io/training/dallas.html">training partner ad</a> and emulating Gym Jones initial success and reputation.
</p>

<p>
  This is how revolutionary ideas are formed. This is how things get done. This is how progress is made.
</p>

<p>
  A few examples of scenes that were brought up (note there is a common thread, a shared interest within each scene):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_project">Manhattan Project</a>: Employed some of the smartest scientists in the world, including Feynman, Fermi, Teller, von Neumann, and Szilard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gym Jones: Brought together some of the best athletes from a variety of disciplines, including fighting, climbing, and cycling, into a single space. Athletes were ultra-competitive and worked harder due to the peer pressure of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/business-financing/startup-incubator">Incubators</a>:
    <blockquote>
      A startup incubator is a collaborative program for startup companies — usually physically located in one central workspace — designed to help startups in their infancy succeed by providing workspace, seed funding, mentoring and training.
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Central">Café Central</a>: A Viennese café that served as a meeting point for intellectuals, such as Adler, Trotsky, and later Freud, Stalin, and Lenin.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States">Founding Fathers</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Qualities of the group include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Positive in-group competition: This is the only way to get substantially better at something. Competition is required and should be encouraged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shared values: As mentioned, there is something common holding the scene together, even if interests are slightly different. For Gym Jones it was sport, for incubators it's the desire to make it, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Rising tide raises all ships": Everyone will benefit from the scene, albeit some more than others. Scenes are non-zero sum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Desirable: Others should want to join the scene whether due to its exclusivity, the content/people it produces, or the benefits offered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Access to tacit knowledge and mentorship: [FINISH]
  </li>
  <LI>
    Willing to donate time and energy: [FINISH, MUST BE WORTH IT]
  </LI>
</ul>
