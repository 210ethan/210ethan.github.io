<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts and Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>
  I learned the term <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biodeutsch">biodeutsch</a>, defined as "non-immigrant-background German", when I commented to my friend in Berlin that there were just a lot of people who looked German. He responded by teaching me the term and telling me to wait until I see what Heidelberg looks like. It did not disappoint. There were German-looking people all over. What constitutes a German-looking person? I don't have a good answer, and I'm sure I was confounded by being in Germany and knowing these people were German.
</p>

<p>
  There were so many tourists in Heidelberg. Chinese, Korean, Russian, French, Dutch, Danes, and Indians (and probably others I'm forgetting). A few things here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Why were so many freakin' tourists in Heidelberg, a seemingly random small German town. Was the giant wine barrel <i>that</i> well-known? Did the small-town reputation draw in crowds from all over (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckenbach,_Texas">Luckenbach, Texas</a>)? Did I just show up on a random day where a bunch of tourists showed up?
  </li>
  <li>
    My friend's mom has a joke that there are actually 200 million Dutch people, but 180 million of them are on vacation at any given time.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's amazing to me how many tourists exist in the world alone. If I was just in Heidelberg and saw that many, imagine how many were in Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, etc. And that's just Germany! And that's just Europe! Data shows there were <a href="https://www.unwto.org/news/tourism-on-track-for-full-recovery-as-new-data-shows-strong-start-to-2023">969 million tourists in 2022</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The smalltowniness of Heidelberg was palpable. The streets were narrow and lined with cafe tables and chairs; cyclists casually rode alongside cars, baskets full of groceries; children frolicked in the streets with their parents (and trick-or-treated on Halloween); people waved at each other with airs of familiarity and love. It was a beautiful feeling and sight I had never seen before. A few more things here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I wonder how much of the neighborly feelings I saw were a "we both live in a small town and are proud of it, so let's be friendly and act like small towners" vs. actually knowing each other. While I've seen proud city-ers before, it just wasn't the same.
  </li>
  <li>
    While I never read it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">Jane Jacobs</a>' views on mixed-use development and walkability is almost certainly "right". Apartments next to businesses next to parks next to homes, safe sidewalks with cars going a safe speed through the streets. Is this happiness? Are suburbs misery? It sure felt and feels like it sometimes.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'd be curious to see what patterns from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language">A Pattern Language</a> are present.
  </li>
</ul>
