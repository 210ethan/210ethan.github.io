<h2 id="day123">Days 1-3: Delayed Flights and Long Flights</h2>

<p>
  I knew weather in New York City (home of the airport I was flying into) was questionable, but I didn't think that no rain nor thunderstorms was enough to prevent flights from coming in! Apparently ATCs did, though, and ordered later flights to NYC canceled. I was hanging out in the <a href="https://capitalonetravel.com/lounges">Capital One DFW lounge</a> when I got the notification. I quickly headed to the American Airlines customer service counter to beat the inevitable crowd of irked travelers, getting there about five minutes before the onslaught. The agent was able to get me on a flight to Pittsburg, followed by a connection to JFK, getting there about two hours before my JFK-Doha flight.

  I headed back to the COL to continue gorging on food and sparkling waters—vacation diet was starting much earlier than expected! I pulled out my Kindle and read Baoshu's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36262251-the-redemption-of-time">Redemption of Time</a> until boarding time. I made an awkward bed in Pittsburg, laying out on the edge of five seats under the arm rests. Surprisingly comfortable using my carry-on as a pillow!
</p>

<p>
  The flight to Doha was 12 hours, but felt much shorter than I was anticipating, probably due to the vast movie selection on the in-flight entertainment system. They had probably 100+ movies: some old, some new; some kids, some adults; some comedy, some action; some short, some long. Something for everyone! I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464335/">Uncharted</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/">Get Out</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146316/">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)</a>. In between movies I read and attempted to sleep. The food was also excellent. I got two pretty delicious meals that were filling and well-timed. I even got another meal on the flight to Bucharest!
</p>

<p>
  I landed, made my way through Romanian customs, and bought a train ticket. Just as I was walking to get on, the door closed, leaving me to wait quite a bit for the next one... until a native went up, pressed the green button on the outside of the door, and voila! it opened right up. Love it. My <a href="../thoughts/oneone.html">one-on-one </a> and travel partner, A, met me at the train station so we could go back to the apartment together.
</p>

<p>
  Food that night was at <a href="https://verv.kitchen/en">verv kitchen</a>, a local vegan restaurant. We both got "veggie curry with basmati rice: basmatic rice, seasonal veggies, onion, coconut milk, garlic, ginger, spices". Excitement of being in Europe staved off sleepiness, so we made our way to Old Town and the center of Bucharest, stopping at <a href="https://www.carucubere.ro/">Caru' cu bere</a>, a pretty well-known Romanian restaurant. I got a vegetable salad, bread, țuică, and a beer.
