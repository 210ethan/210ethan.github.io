<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Driving and Dinnering</h2>

<p>
  L and I left home base armed to the teeth with snacks, drinks, and childish excitement at the weekend festivities that awaited us in the German town of Fredericksburg (FB). The beautiful weather and scenic drive combined well with the banger of a playlist L compiled, making for a fun drive (along with playing the extremely-distracting-for-multiple-reasons game "Perfiddle" (or something like that, I butchered the name and just kept with Perfiddle) she taught me). The stretch of road just outside of FB was especially beautiful: golden afternoon sunlight shone through the small orchards and on the vast grassy fields. Was this heaven?
</p>

<p>
  The Airbnb we stayed at was wonderful and legitimately deserving of five stars for a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The host was extremely kind leading up to, during, and after our stay, both in-person (we ran into her while leaving) and over messaging (examples below)
  </li>
  <li>
    A complimentary meat/fruit/cheese board awaited us once we got inside, along with two local beers
  </li>
  <li>
    The kitchen was well-labeled and had everything we needed
  </li>
  <li>
    The bathroom had robes (what Airbnb ever offers robes?)
  </li>
  <li>
    The view was wonderful, overlooking a nice grassy field that included the new cow and sheep friends we made
  </li>
  <li>
    Location is a very safe, albeit sidewalk-less, 10-minute walk from Main Street
  </li>
  <li>
    There was an absolutely PACKED guestbook with suggestions on what to do around FB, both hidden gems and tourist traps alike
  </li>
  <li>
    Late afternoon light created an incredibly-relaxing ambience in the bedroom (did I mention I like afternoon sunlight?)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  L and I changed into our finest dinner attires and walked to <a href="https://www.ottosfbg.com/">Otto's German Bistro</a>, one of FB's few upscale restaurants. And fine dining it was:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Flammkuchen: house made flatbread | crème fraîche | candied bacon | caramelized onions | cambozola | gruyère | aged balsamic | arugula
  </li>
  <li>
    Sauerkraut Balls: crispy sauerkraut & sausage | whole grain mustard crème fraîche
  </li>
  <li>
    Duck Schnitzel: breaded duck breast | käsespätzle | rotkohl | kirsch demi-glacé | duck cracklings
  </li>
  <li>
    Pork Paprika Schnitzel: pork loin schnitzel | käsespätzle| rotkohl | paprika gravy | pickled sweet peppers
  </li>
  <li>
    Shokoreigel: flourless chocolate torte, coco nibs, kirsch gelée, brandied cherries
  </li>
  <li>
    (a bottle of Austrian red wine whose name I cannot remember)
  </li>
  <li>
    (a gin drink whose ingredients I cannot remember)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The entire meal—food, company, and vibe—was phenomenal.

<p>
  I begrudgingly left the warmness and coziness of the bed for a training ride in the 40 °F weather and steady 20 mph wind. I seemed to have forgotten what hard hill riding feels like.
</p>

<p>
  With feet dethawed in the warm shower and our second finest attires donned, we headed out for another tasty day, starting at <a href="https://www.hillandvinetx.com/">Hill & Vine</a> with a chicken schnitzel scramble, toast, and coffee. My blinders were fully engaged the entire time.
</p>

<p>
  A windy 10-minute walk put us at the pickup point of the <a href="https://290wineshuttle.com/">290 Wine Shuttle</a>. What a freaking awesome business, both in the idea and the execution.
