  Maybe it was the post-bike ride hunger (but probably wasn't since I ate a pound or two of meat at a Brazilian steakhouse earlier in the day), but this was pretty darn good.
</p>

<p>
  I got two tacos:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cowboy: dry-rubbed beef tenderloin, grilled corn, caramelized onion, roasted peppers, guacamole
  </li>
  <li>
    Mojo Salmon: grilled atlantic salmon, mojo-garlic sauce, guacamole, pico de gallo
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both of them had a healthy serving of guacamole, which isn't always my thing, but definitely gets others going. Meat seemed fresh and tender. Flour tortillas not too doughy nor thin.

  I had <a href="https://www.richardsrainwater.com/">Richard's Rainwater</a> along with four to five cups of their on-tap soda water. They also have a decent drink menu.
</p>

<p>
  Total price was $12. A bit pricey for me considering the portions, but the quality was worth it. Happy I went!

  This was suggested by a friend, and now I owe him a big one. There's a small "restaurant" (if you can even call it that) right when you walk in. They have a variety of plates, family-style combos, or individual items (tacos, burritos, etc). I got the #1 for $16 altogether: one pound of chicken or carnitas, 8 oz rice, 8 oz beans (they gave me refried, I would have chosen charro), a dozen corn tortillas, and a few cups of salsa verde.
</p>

<p>
  Everything was fantastic. Corn tortillas were obviously fresh. Carnitas was a mix of already-pulled and chunks of meat, all juicy. Rice moist as I like it. Didn't try the beans. Salsa wasn't too mild nor too spicy.

<p>
  And I'd be doing a disservice to the business if I didn't talk about everything else. The bakery had a variety of sweets, including conchas (Mexican sweet bread), churros, and other traditional Mexican pastries. They had a mini tortilla factory pumping out fresh flour and corn tortillas. Their meat selection was like no other: chicken, pork, beef, marinated, non-marinated, seasoned, non-seasoned, fatty, lean, high-quality, not-so-high-quality, cheap, cheaper! This will probably be my go-to place for large meat orders, especially considering they're already marinated and the price is very competitive.
</p>

<p>
  Highly recommend going here for the portion vs. price ratio and wide selection of other products.
