<h1 id="restaurants">Restaurant Reviews</h1>

<p>
  My experiences at restaurants mostly across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, along with a few others. I don't claim to be a food connoisseur—this page is to help me remember what I've eaten and offer suggestions to others.
</p>

<p>
  As with other pages on this website, I use tags to make things easily searchable by category.

  This taqueria was recommended by a friend for their $1 trompo tacos. I had finished about six hours of continuous yard work, so I was hungry as heck and ready to chow down.
</p>

<p>
  I ordered six spicy pork tamales, two chicken tacos, two carne asada tacos, two trompo tacos, a regular churro, and a frozen mango margarita to wash it all down. Tacos came with two tortillas per, along with regular and grilled onions and beans. For $2.50 per two tacos, the portions were excellent. (Sadly, the $1 taco Tuesday deal only extended to the trompo tacos.)
</p>

<p>
  There were quite a few other options on the menu. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly. Service a bit slow, but they were busy, so no harm.

<h3 id="desta">Desta</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Name: Desta Ethiopian Restaurant
  </li>
  <li>
    Address: 12101 Greenville Ave #105, Dallas, TX 75243

    Cuisine: Ethiopian

</ul>

<p>
  It appears the area Desta is in is pretty Ethiopian, or at least they come from miles around—my friend and I were the only non-Ethiopian people in the restaurant (out of 20-30!).
</p>

<p>
  Service timeliness was quite poor. It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks, then 20 minutes to get the checks after we were obviously done. The waiter was very nice and joked around with us a bit.
</p>

<p>
  I got doro wot, which comes with injera, the Ethiopian "sponge" bread (or so it looks):
</p>

<blockquote>
  Slow cooked spicy chicken made with hot berbere (chili) sauce flavored with onion and garlic
</blockquote>

<p>
  Ethiopian food is generally eaten by tearing off a piece of injera and using it to "claw" the food, creating a mini-sandwich of sorts. It was pretty awkward doing this with chili, but a solid grip followed by a dip gets enough of it on the bread.
</p>

<p>
  This dish came with a single chicken drum, and for the price of $18.00 (not including gratuity), that's unreasonable. There was plenty of the sauce, though.
</p>

<p>
  While I enjoyed the experience, I would not come back here because a) slow service, b) small portions, and c) excessive price.

<p>
  An upscale sushi restaurant in the heart of Uptown, this place definitely gives off nice vibes. The hosts/waiters are swankily-dressed and all young and good-looking. The overall restaurant is clean and sharp. We sat in the covered patio area directly out front and were quickly met by our waiter.
</p>

<p>
  I don't know much about sake, but the menu was extensive (as well as their Japanese whiskey collection). We got 10 oz of a lower-quality sake and my friend got an old fashioned which tasted good. I love the large single cube they used.
</p>

<p>
  I got two rolls:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sake New Style: salmon, salmon skin, avocado, wasabi salsa, caramel dashi. This was phenomenal. I've never had salmon that tender and chewy. The wasabi was almost sweet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Chef's Special: Japanese Mackerel with mint and some other stuff I can't remember. This tasted <i>fishy</i>. Delicious, but fishy. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Our waitress was a bit pushy about ordering more food. I'm not sure if it's expected to order two or more rolls per person (we got four between three of us), but she was definitely selling the menu hard, to a point of "leave us alone". No music was heard, no boisterous parties were present, and the atmosphere was relaxed and fun.
</p>

<p>
  Price wasn't horrible at $170 for four rolls, edamame, sake, a cocktail, and sparkling water.

<p>
  Maybe it was the post-bike ride hunger (but probably wasn't since I ate a pound or two of meat at a Brazilian steakhouse earlier in the day), but this was pretty darn good.
</p>

<p>
  I got two tacos:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cowboy: dry-rubbed beef tenderloin, grilled corn, caramelized onion, roasted peppers, guacamole
  </li>
  <li>
    Mojo Salmon: grilled atlantic salmon, mojo-garlic sauce, guacamole, pico de gallo
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both of them had a healthy serving of guacamole, which isn't always my thing, but definitely gets others going. Meat seemed fresh and tender. Flour tortillas not too doughy nor thin.
</p>

<p>
  I had <a href="https://www.richardsrainwater.com/">Richard's Rainwater</a> along with four to five cups of their on-tap soda water. They also have a decent drink menu.
</p>

<p>
  Total price was $12. A bit pricey for me considering the portions, but the quality was worth it. Happy I went!

  This was suggested by a friend, and now I owe him a big one. There's a small "restaurant" (if you can even call it that) right when you walk in. They have a variety of plates, family-style combos, or individual items (tacos, burritos, etc). I got the #1 for $16 altogether: one pound of chicken or carnitas, 8 oz rice, 8 oz beans (they gave me refried, I would have chosen charro), a dozen corn tortillas, and a few cups of salsa verde.
</p>

<p>
  Everything was fantastic. Corn tortillas were obviously fresh. Carnitas was a mix of already-pulled and chunks of meat, all juicy. Rice moist as I like it. Didn't try the beans. Salsa wasn't too mild nor too spicy.
</p>

<p>
  And I'd be doing a disservice to the business if I didn't talk about everything else. The bakery had a variety of sweets, including conchas (Mexican sweet bread), churros, and other traditional Mexican pastries. They had a mini tortilla factory pumping out fresh flour and corn tortillas. Their meat selection was like no other: chicken, pork, beef, marinated, non-marinated, seasoned, non-seasoned, fatty, lean, high-quality, not-so-high-quality, cheap, cheaper! This will probably be my go-to place for large meat orders, especially considering they're already marinated and the price is very competitive.
</p>

<p>
  Highly recommend going here for the portion vs. price ratio and wide selection of other products.
