<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Americans in Paris</h2>

<p>
  (Yes, that subtitle is a play on the Kanye-Jay-Z song.)
</p>

<p>
  My worst fears were realized soon into the flight: there was no video entertainment. I was going have to... *gasp* read! Soon after this realization I prepared for the first-ever riot at 30,000 ft in the air, checking if I could use my seatmates as human protection. But there was no riot, and I had luckily downloaded David Foster Wallace's <a href="https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf">Shipping Out</a> (part of A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again). So I read, and tried to sleep, and read some more, and tried to sleep some more until the overhead lights simulated sunrise and I realized we had entered France.
</p>

<p>
  The area surrounding Paris is almost entirely farmland with small villages dotted throughout, connected by either a paved or gravel road (duh) and with a handful of actual homes on the outside. It was the French village I had pictured in my mind up until that moment and generally held true for up until my last few days.
</p>

<p>
  I arrived in Paris proper via the metro, finding a coincidence of epic proportions: my brother, sister-in-law, and friend, E, with whom I was traveling, were all in the same train station—brother/SIL and friend didn't even know about it! The odds of being in the same continent-country-city-station at the same time on the same Saturday morning is vanishingly small, and yet it happened without planning (although I did know brother/SIL were leaving from there that day and E did not).
</p>

<p>
  E and I walked the 15 minutes to our hotel and found it was exactly what we needed: one queen bed inside a small bedroom with a bathroom. The bare essentials and nothing more. We unloaded, changed, and were off to explore the City of Love (as friends). Notre Dame was as expansive as it was intricate, the Eiffel Tower as beautiful as it was looming, the Louvre as angular as it was crowded. The atmosphere was one of happiness, style, and haughtiness (which, in fairness, is probably well-deserved). We experienced no rudeness like I was warned about from multiple people, only blank stares from passerby and broken English from restaurant waiters.
</p>

<p>
  It was a wonderful, exhausting introduction to the city.

<h2 id="day2">Day 2: Versailles</h2>

<p>
  We slept for close to 12 hours after I completely turned off my alarm three separate times—jet lag was real! We snagged a breakfast of ham, scrambled eggs, cheese, bread, crepes, coffee, and fresh orange juice at a nearby cafe before continuing deeper into the city towards our train station.
</p>

<p>
  Our first stop was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centre-pompidou">Centre Pompidou</a>, a massive industrial-looking building housing Europe's largest modern art museum. We then toured <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/59-rivoli">59 Rivoli</a>, a five-floor building with multiple active artist studios on each, ranging from modern paintings to landscapes to physical sculptures.
