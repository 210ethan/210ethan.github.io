  His whispers sound like gale force winds.

  I finally hit 50+ mph on my bicycle. I have been trying (when possible, which isn't often) for almost three years. It's a speed few riders hit due to geography and, more importantly, fear. While I <i>probably</i> wouldn't have died if I crashed, it sure wouldn't have been pretty for my body nor bike.

<p>
  The achievement happened during my <a href="../training/races.html#everesting4">Everesting IV</a> effort:

  I was booking it down the final straightaway in an aero tuck position, fingers posed over the brakes to convince my mind I had some semblance of control when it was obvious I didn't. My fate was left to the mercy of the mechanical integrity of my bicycle components, the construction quality of the road, and the will of any animals that had an urge to cross the road without looking. All I could do was hold on tight and try to remember where that manhole cover was. The sound of the air in my ears was deafening, providing some distraction to the immense danger that was an instant away the entire descent.

  It's cool being that close to danger. Call me arrogant, naive, innocent, young, whatever. 26-year-old me currently finds it cool, and while I won't go seeking it out in the future, I wouldn't stop myself from experiencing it again. Is the reward worth the risk? Absolutely not, but it's a cool bragging point at parties or when trying to pick up girls in your hometown-that-you-never-left bar.

  Some suggestions for those seeking the same thrill:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Skinny tires are required
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the longest straight hill possible. Steeper is preferred over length, but there is a minimum for both.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/super-tuck-vs-aero-tuck/">Tucking</a> is required. Super tuck is preferred.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure everything on the bike is tight and in good condition
  </li>
</ul>
