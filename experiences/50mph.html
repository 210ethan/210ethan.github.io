<h1 id="50mph">Riding with Death</h1>

<p>
  Okay, the title is a bit clickbaity. I <i>probably</i> wouldn't die if I crashed going 50 mph (80 kmh) on my bike, but it sure wouldn't be pretty. I originally got this idea after a good friend told me he hit 51.0 mph on his bike and was terrified. That got me thinking: how many people do I know who have gone 50 mph on their bikes? While I haven't gone around asking, I'd venture to say less than 3. It's a barrier few hit due to geography and, more importantly, fear. You need a long, smooth, straight hill that you can get some speed into. At those speeds and with the bike required (skinny tires are a must, good luck hitting that on a mountain bike), the smallest bump, rock, or crack can throw off your balance and send you flying. Is the reward worth the risk? Probably not, but it's a cool bragging point at parties or when trying to pick up chicks in your hometown-that-you-never-left bar.

  The rules I'm setting for myself are simple: the 50 mph must be reached entirely of my own accord. Wind is allowed, but skitching or external assistance by another person is not. I will use Strava to track the speed.
