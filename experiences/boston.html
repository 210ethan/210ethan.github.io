<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Stares</h2>

<p>
  Call me a pompous douche, but my usual airport lounge—the one that silently forces me to arrive three hours before any flight, regardless of the time—has lost its allure. The sparkling water is gone; the dish options are bland and always the same; the waitlist gives off an air of non-exclusivity (I want to look down upon those who can't get in, damn it!). My friend loved it, though, and that's what matters.
</p>

<p>
  Our Uber took 20 minutes door-to-door, taking us through an obviously Hispanic neighborhood that is Jeffries Point, across the bay from and directly east of downtown. E and I touched down at the Airbnb and were immediately ready to explore thanks to the power naps we snuck in during the flight. Off we went!
</p>

<p>
  And down fell the excitement after realizing kitchens were closed. And further down fell the excitement when we discovered this not by a sign on the window or some Google Maps info, but by walking in, standing around while getting gawked at by the patrons (we were obviously out-of-towners), and asking in Spanish (shoutout F) if it was open for food. It wasn't. I settled for an energy bar and losing any and all hope of a proper meal when the food truck showed up. I had seen it on the drive in, but the two simple turns past it combined with the dark, unfamiliar Bostonian streets were enough for me to lose my sense of direction and thus the key to a satisfied stomach. But here it was in all of its Colombian, broken-English glory. I ordered the arepas and we took them to the waterfront to chat and eat with views of the skyline in front of us.

  We awoke late in the morning and headed for Boston-regular T's favorite donut place: <a href="https://www.kanesdonuts.com/">Kane's Donuts</a>. While they had a Boston cream pie donut on the menu, I was skeptical... was it the ultimate Boston litmus test to check for someone's tourist status, much like ordering swiss on a Philly cheesesteak (hint: don't do this, but if you do, prepare to be mocked and laughed at by any Philly native—just ask <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3kj9vj/tbt-how-a-philly-cheesesteak-destroyed-america">John Kerry</a>)? In an effort to conform to those around me, I quickly searched the internet, finding that the Boston cream pie was "created in 1856 by Armenian-French chef Mossburg Sanzian at the Parker House Hotel in Boston", "is the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleI/Chapter2/Section41">official dessert of Massachusetts</a>", and the "Boston cream doughnut was designated the <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleI/Chapter2/Section51">official doughnut of Massachusetts</a> in 2003".
</p>

<p>
  Next stop was the <a href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/">Freedom Trail</a>, a 2.5-mile trail connecting 16 historic sites in and around Boston. I'll be honest, I don't remember any of them besides the cemetery where a few famous folk were buried (including John Hancock, but did he <i>really</i> do anything besides sign his name like in this most obnoxious way possible?) and the state house. I was much more fascinated at the juxtaposition of buildings. We saw ancient churches in the foreground and massive skyscrapers looming over them in the background; we saw a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3574418,-71.0584036,3a,75y,343.56h,92.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sF2aR8Nmnk0evv0DHqyB0OQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205409&entry=ttu">Chipotle inside a very old building</a>, only turning around to see a very modern Walgreens; we saw borderline-dilapidated brick roads supporting the weight of $100k+ cars accelerating on a dime. On a less depressing note, I came in second for the game of who could stay on the red path the longest without falling off.
</p>

<p>
  We followed the red brick road not to Kansas, not to Oz, but to...you guessed it!... <a href="http://www.warrentavern.com/">Warren Tavern</a>. The food was unremarkable and we had a server who introduced himself as Cookie. Need I say more?
</p>

<p>
  Bunker Hill was closed off to us because the heat index was greater than 95 °F and that was apparently unsafe. Um, what? 95's a cool day for me and my fellow statesmen. I guess Boston people are just built different (worse). No waivers, no sneaking by, no begging and pleading, nothing. We weren't getting in and that was that. But it didn't matter because a rainbow-colored cloud (on my phone's weather app; the actual cloud was a menacing grey, the kind that says get the heck inside if you know what's good for you and your personal electronics) was quickly approaching. The wind began howling, indicating we should probably start going in the opposite direction in search of cover. It was closer now and outpacing us by a large amount, meaning we'd have to hole up on someone's porch or find a business. We opted for the latter, choosing to get beers at a pizza parlor instead of the rather uninviting dollar store across the street.
