<p>
  I live a fairly comfortable life. I live in 700 square foot apartment that includes air conditioning and heating on a safe part of town, own three different bicycles, have a reliable car, get to eat out when I want, and so on and so forth. I recognize how lucky I am and appreciate it every day, both in the form of thinking how awesome everything I have is and how not awesome everything I don't experience is. For example, I don't have to worry about the power shutting off because I didn't pay the bill on time. I don't have to worry about where my next meal is coming from or experience unwanted hunger. I don't have to wear hand-me-downs (yet I still wear the same five shirts to work every week).
</p>

<p>
  I am an avid believer in abstinence for satisfaction (post coming soon), or abstaining from something for a determined amount of time in order to increase the satisfaction one obtains when finally experiencing that something again. This practice works especially well on routine actions that are often taken for granted. I occasionally fast for 24 hours and find my evening meal tastes much better, despite it being the exact same thing as the previous night. Whenever I am starting to get sick of training (exercising), I take a week off to let me body recuperate and end up itching to train by the end of it. I will stay up extra late to appreciate my warm bed and quiet, dark room.
</p>

<p>
  This experiment is designed to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Help me understand the plights of individuals living near the poverty line
  </li>
  <li>
    Help me gain a greater appreciation for my good fortune (hard work can only get you so far)
  </li>
</ol>

  Based on United Way's <a href="https://www.unitedforalice.org/household-budgets/texas">Texas ALICE report</a> (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed), the annual total for a single adult is $22320, or $1860 per month (I'll call this MT, or monthly total). This is the amount I will attempt to spend in my 30 days.
</p>

<p>
  Let's examine a few fixed-cost items that I will not or cannot give up and subtract those from MT.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Housing: Because I am already paying for my current apartment and there are other options out there for cheaper than Texas ALICE's housing budget of $608, I will call $608 my monthly housing cost, making MT = $1252.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gym: I enjoy going to the gym for $60/month. MT = $1192.
  </li>
  <li>
    Car and renter's insurance: MT = $1120.
  </li>
  <li>
    Internet: MT = $1055.
  </li>
  <li>
    Miscellaneous (from empirical data, estimated): $1000
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following items are variable and can be changed depending on how well I am doing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Groceries
  </li>
  <li>
    Eating out
  </li>
  <li>
    Gas
  </li>
  <li>
    Fun
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  It's important to note that I have quite a few things that people in poverty would not be able to afford, and thus I will not be using these on my own. These include, but are not limited to, my Xbox One, Concept2 rower, Turner Flux mountain bike, and collection of other fitness equipment. I will not wear the multiple shoes, I have, but just two pairs: casual and exercise. I will only wear cheaper shirts.
</p>

<p>
  I will continue to use my 6KU Fixie (because the $200 price tag could be considered a nice Christmas gift) and Ibis Ripley (because I enjoy doing mental gymnastics to justify my using it).
</p>

<p>
  In the end, I should have the following amount of money left in my bank account: $(original amount + 2x(normal paycheck) - 1860). If my bank account is less than this amount, I failed. Else, I succeeded.
