<h2 id="day_1">Day 1: Flight In and Sleep for Dinner</h2>

<p>
  We (my friend, J, and I) arrived at DFW airport around 5:30am, got through security (no PreCheck this time—oh how bad I have it), and waited around. Watched <i>F9: The Fast Saga</i> and talked to old guy next to me. (Side note: huge props to airlines—at least American, I can't speak to others—for making entertainment free on flights. Definitely makes me want to fly with them a bit more than other airlines.
</p>

<p>
  Second flight was delayed two hours due to a faulty intercom, but they eventually found another plane and off we went. J and I watched <i>Casino Royale</i> together, followed by gazing out the window at the lush blanket of orange/golden clouds we were flying over. The flight landed, we went through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnzito1Nz-0">zombie-movie-like COVID check-in process</a>, then grabbed a $30 taxi to our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10096511">Airbnb condo</a> in Sapphire Village on the northeast side of the island, a five-minute drive north of Red Hook.
</p>

<p>
  Exhausted from traveling and too lazy to grab a cab over to Red Hook for dinner, we had some delicious sleep for dinner.

<h2 id="day_2">Day 2: First Sight of Beaches</h2>

<p>
  We woke around 6:00am and headed down to <a href="https://beachbuzzvi.com/">The Beach Buzz</a>, located a steep 10-minute walk away. I had a decently-sized sausage-egg-cheese bagel with an iced chai and lovely sunrise view on the side. We walked the beach, saw some crabs, then went back to prep our snorkel gear for the day.
</p>

<p>
  A five-minute taxi took us to <a href="https://www.vinow.com/stt/stt-b/lindquist-beach/">Lindquist Beach</a> just down the road. $5/person entry fee. We set our stuff on a sun chair and were promptly (but kindly) told it was $5 for a chair. Seriously?! Now, whether this guy was trying to scam unsuspecting tourists who would happily pay a measly $5 for some comfort is unknown to us as we declined the shitty offer and opted for a picnic table instead.
</p>

<p>
  Snorkeling here was pretty sweet. Not much in terms of variety, but the water was fairly clear and the coral sections on the east side offered some interesting flora.
</p>

  Lunch was at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hook'd+USVI/@18.3248924,-64.8525348,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x81b63c21ff2129a1!8m2!3d18.3249305!4d-64.8524759">Hook'd</a>, a waterfront restaurant in Red Hook. I had a couple <a href="https://stjohnbrewers.com/pages/love-city-hard-seltzer">St. John Brewers' Love City Hard Seltzers</a> along with fish tacos. "Dessert" was had at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duffy's+Love+Shack/@18.3256307,-64.853036,18.23z/data=!4m14!1m8!3m7!1s0x8c0511b02f21adf5:0x711d01ac9cbb4c6f!2sSudi's+Caribbean+Bar+%26+Grille!8m2!3d18.3322128!4d-64.8487899!14m1!1BCgIgAQ!3m4!1s0x0:0xc4773e5ac182df97!8m2!3d18.3256628!4d-64.8521926">Duffy's Love Shack</a>, a popular bar in the middle of Red Hook. They have a pretty extensive drink menu, and for just an extra $5, you get a sweet mug to drink with <i>and</i> take home.
</p>

<p>
  Dinner consisted of double cheeseburgers and vodka cocktails at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sapphire+Beach+Bar/@18.3350127,-64.8513248,18.13z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x81b63c21ff2129a1!2sHook'd+USVI!8m2!3d18.3249305!4d-64.8524759!3m4!1s0x8c05104907a5cbc1:0xb6db5f7e2951ef9!8m2!3d18.3350442!4d-64.8508085">Sapphire Beach Bar</a>. Good god that thing was delicious, or maybe we were just crazy hungry, or maybe a mix of both.

<h2 id="day_3">Day 3: Vertical Hiking, Turtles, and the Coveted Bushwhacker</h2>

<p>
  A 45-minute shuttle took us all the way across the island to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brewers+Bay+Beach/@18.3435465,-64.9945021,14z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8c051b0b47a3d2b9:0x8a8488729938bd99!2sBrewers+Bay+Beach!3b1!8m2!3d18.3435476!4d-64.9769925!3m4!1s0x8c051b0b47a3d2b9:0x8a8488729938bd99!8m2!3d18.3435476!4d-64.9769925">Brewers Bay Beach</a>, located directly north of the airport (the runway is visible from the beach itself, it's that close!).
</p>

<p>
  But before the water could be felt, it needed to be earned.
</p>

<p>
  Payment was through the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hookie+Spot-+John+Brewers+Cave+Hike/@18.346721,-64.9802393,16.51z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x8c051b0b47a3d2b9:0x8a8488729938bd99!2sBrewers+Bay+Beach!3b1!8m2!3d18.3435476!4d-64.9769925!3m4!1s0x8c051b9d2b5c0149:0xac44f0d3fb785925!8m2!3d18.3464496!4d-64.9772004">Brewers Cave Hike</a>, which puts hikers at an awesome rocky vantage point overlooking the bay and the airport. The trail itself is dangerously steep and is probably not for anyone who is out of shape. It took us about 30:00 minutes to get to the top. Beers (or another otherwise refreshing beverage) are recommended to celebrate the summiting.
</p>

<p>
  Lunch was two delicious empanadas—one swordfish and one beef—and a cold beer. Swordfish was excellent, although I was a bit apprehensive about eating it from the food truck parked alongside the beach...
</p>

<p>
  Snorkeling was solid and a welcome change from the past few days. We saw a couple of sea turtles meandering gracefully and small stingrays sticking close to the bottom. We played sand games and hid from the short Caribbean downpour.
</p>

<p>
  Dinner was at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sudi's+Caribbean+Bar+%26+Grille/@18.3326152,-64.849405,17.87z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c0511b02f21adf5:0x711d01ac9cbb4c6f!8m2!3d18.3322128!4d-64.8487899">Sudi's Caribbean Bar & Grille</a>, birthplace of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwacker_(cocktail)">Bushwacker</a> (albeit the restaurant was under a different name, but still in the same place in spirit and location—a short spiel on the history <a href="https://www.bushwackerspirits.com/history">here</a>). And lemme tell ya, that thing is as good as it is famous (around the islands, that is).
</p>

<p>
  Wikipedia's description is wrong:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The original recipe called for Vodka, Kahlua, Dark Crème de Cacao, Coco Lopez (cream of coconut), a splash of Triple sec and milk that's spun in a blender with ice and topped with a grating of fresh nutmeg.
</blockquote>

<p>
  And the true recipe can be found <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/bushwacker-drink/">here</a>, although they forget the prime ingredient of nutmeg, which should be shaved onto the top:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Aged rum
    </li>
    <li>
      Kahlua
    </li>
    <li>
      Creme de cacao
    </li>
    <li>
      Cream of coconut
    </li>
    <li>
      Milk
    </li>
    <li>
      Ice
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I've noticed the nutmeg topping is a popular choice amongst Caribbean drinks: Bushwackers use it, <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/painkiller-cocktail/">Painkillers</a> use it, and I had a few more lesser-known drinks that also used it. So I investigated the history. From <a href="https://spicetrekkers.com/news/rum-punch-with-nutmeg-the-real-story">this blog post on rum punch with nutmeg</a>, they mention:
</p>

<blockquote>
  We take our nutmeg very seriously in the Caribbean. West Indians have a long-standing culinary tradition which has informed us well over the generations. Nutmeg is very important to the taste balance of this drink because it is an aromatic spice which links the acidity of the lime, the bitterness of the rum and the copious amount of sugar called for in the recipe. It is as indispensable to an authentic rum punch as brown rum
</blockquote>

<p>
  Nutmeg came to Grenada in 1843, where it still produces nutmeg to this day and has since been nicknamed "Spice Island", even going so far as to add a nutmeg to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Grenada#/media/File:Flag_of_Grenada.svg">their flag</a>. I'll take the above quote's word as to why it's so popular in drinks down here.
</p>

<h2 id="day_4">Day 4: Snorkeling in St. John</h2>

<p>
  We were up early to catch the 6:30am ferry over to St. John, possibly getting scammed along the way. A stranger in his truck picked us up since he was on his way to Red Hook, and somewhere along the mile stretch of road his rear passenger tire failed. This isn't unreasonable: the roads here are pretty rough, especially the one between Sapphire Beach and Red Hook. But what set my alarms off was him sounding like he expected <i>us</i> to help him. Sorry, we got a ferry to catch and it ain't my fault. I'd consider helping another time.
</p>

<p>
  We made it to the Westin about an hour early and futzed around on the beach and the grounds, as well as meeting a couple of people who were going on the same excursion.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g147409-d23030388-St_John_Full_Day_Lime_Out_Snorkel_Sail_w_Taco_Lunch_Open_Bar_Westin-St_John_U_S_Vi.html">St. John Full-Day Lime Out Snorkel Sail w/ Taco Lunch & Open Bar - Westin</a> was an excellent experience. $240-ish in the end (fee plus gratuity) for two separate snorkel spots, two boutique tacos from <a href="https://www.limeoutvi.com/">Lime Out</a>, and unlimited alcohol.
</p>

<p>
  The day started with a waffle and fruit breakfast (among other options) in calm waters, but some strong headwind quickly made for choppy waves and queasy stomachs. We got to the first snorkel spot in about 30 min and enjoyed it for an hour. Nothing new or noteworthy from what we had seen the past couple of days.
</p>

<p>
  Before heading to Lime Out, I downed two or three seltzers and was feeling gooooooooooooood.
</p>

<p>
  Like I said, Lime Out has some pretty boutique/eccentric/speciality tacos and I'd recommend going there if in the (remote) area. I personally had the Surf + Turf:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Short rib + blackened shrimp, feta cheese, local organic microgreens, radishes, guacamole
</blockquote>

<p>
  The Rum Rib:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Pulled pork, house local rum barbecue sauce, chipotle cole slaw, roasted corn
</blockquote>

<p>
  And The Danger to wash them down:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Thai chili infused 100% blue agave tequila, fresh watermelon juice, fresh lime juice, pineapple simple syrup
</blockquote>

  The scene around Lime Out
</figcaption>

<p>
  Another 30-minute ride got us to the next snorkel spot. I spent about 20:00 minutes swimming around before heading back to the boat. Two more seltzers were knocked back followed by a sunny nap on the net between the two hulls.
</p>

<p>
  We got back to the Westin around 3:00pm, made our back way to Cruz Bay, and ate at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cruz+Bay+Landing/@18.3315592,-64.7952167,18.62z/data=!4m8!1m2!3m1!2sCruz+Bay+Landing!3m4!1s0x8c05123c3ff387a5:0xbc02184cec578c9b!8m2!3d18.3312664!4d-64.7947218">Cruz Bay Landing</a>. Subpar portions, the food was average, would not recommend.
</p>

<p>
  Dinner consisted of a whopping 14 hours of alcohol-induced sleep. I fell asleep at 6:00pm to get a power nap in before dinner reservations at 8:30pm, J woke me up asking if it was cool if he canceled, I gave an affirmative grunt, then promptly let my head hit the cool, soft, inviting pillow until 8:00am the next day. My god was that nice.
</p>

<h2 id="day_5">Day 5: History and a Fancy Dinner</h2>

<p>
  Most of St. Thomas' history is nestled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Amalie,_U.S._Virgin_Islands">Charlotte Amalie</a>, the capital city of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</p>

<h2 id="day_6">Day 6: Sapphire Beach and Sake</h2>

<p>
  Day 6 was as chill of a day as we've had yet. We strolled down to Sapphire Beach around 11:00am to find a sizable crowd, but not big enough that we couldn't find a spot. With towels laid out and sunscreen applied, I finished the rest of Trust, book one of LessWrong's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/books/2019">Engines of Cognitions</a>. Lunch was at Sapphire Beach Bar again.
</p>

<p>
  Dinner was at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Raw+Sushi+%26+Sake+Bar/@18.3251589,-64.8549483,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c0511abd0aac283:0x6c27b02677e11451!8m2!3d18.3251589!4d-64.8527596">Raw Sushi and Sake Bar</a>. We had the Iguana Go Home roll:
</p>

<blockquote>
  blackened tuna / avocado / cucumber / grilled pineapple / jalapeño / creame cheese / kimchi aioli
</blockquote>

<p>
  The Off Da' Hook roll:
</p>

<blockquote>
  red snapper / tuna / cucumber / mango cream cheese / togarashi / crab-wakame salad / wasabi aioli
</blockquote>

<p>
  And 750 mL of warm house sake, plus a Spicy Geisha (only me):
</p>

<blockquote>
  jalapeño-infused tequila / lemon juice / lime juice / blackberry shrub / chili-sugar rim
</blockquote>

<p>
  This was probably the most fun dinner. The table next to us gave J a friendly sample of their sake so he could try it before we ordered, so I repaid the favor by getting him a Spicy Geisha. This ignited the conversation and we learned about their backstory. A couple from the midwest U.S., they concocted the idea of moving down to the Caribbean within the next 10 years (from the date of inception). And it actually happened! They progressively downsized their living over that decade, eventually having enough to purchase a catamaran and move down here full-time to do full-service chartering around the Virgin Islands.
