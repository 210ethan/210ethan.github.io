<h2 id="day_1">Day 1: </h2>

<p>
  We (my friend, J, and I) arrived at DFW airport around 5:30am, got through security (no PreCheck this time—oh how bad I have it), and waited around. Watched <i>F9: The Fast Saga</i> and talked to old guy next to me. (Side note: huge props to airlines—at least American, I can't speak to others—for making entertainment free on flights. Definitely makes me want to fly with them a bit more than other airlines.
</p>

<p>
  Second flight was delayed two hours due to a faulty intercom, but they eventually found another plane and off we went. J and I watched <i>Casino Royale</i> together, followed by gazing out the window at the lush blanket of orange/golden clouds we were flying over. The flight landed, we went through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnzito1Nz-0">zombie-movie-like COVID check-in process</a>, then grabbed a $30 taxi to our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10096511">Airbnb condo</a> in Sapphire Village on the northeast side of the island, a five-minute drive north of Red Hook.
</p>

<p>
  Exhausted from traveling and too lazy to grab a cab over to Red Hook for dinner, we had some delicious sleep for dinner.

<h2 id="day_2">Day 2: </h2>

<p>
  We woke around 6:00am and headed down to <a href="https://beachbuzzvi.com/">The Beach Buzz</a>, located a steep 10-minute walk away. I had a decently-sized sausage-egg-cheese bagel with an iced chai and lovely sunrise view on the side. We walked the beach, saw some crabs, then went back to prep our snorkel gear for the day.
</p>

<p>
  A five-minute taxi took us to <a href="https://www.vinow.com/stt/stt-b/lindquist-beach/">Lindquist Beach</a> just down the road. $5/person entry fee. We set our stuff on a sun chair and were promptly (but kindly) told it was $5 for a chair. Seriously?! Now, whether this guy was trying to scam unsuspecting tourists who would happily pay a measly $5 for some comfort is unknown to us as we declined the shitty offer and opted for a picnic table instead.
</p>

<p>
  Snorkeling here was pretty sweet.
