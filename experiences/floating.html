<h1 id="floating">Floating in Nothing</h1>

<p>
  Experience with floating for 25 min in a sensory deprivation tank.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Frankly, this was a very underwhelming experience. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting going into this, but it definitely wasn't <i>that</i>. (To clarify, the presentation and hospitality of the spa was superb, and (mostly) nothing was done wrong on their part.)
</p>

<p>
  With my body thoroughly washed and ear plugs installed, I opened the tank door and was met with a mini-burst of humid air. My foot touched the foot-deep 93 Â°F water, expecting to feel salt crystals or slush or <i>something</i>, but it felt just like regular water. I sealed the door behind me, engrossing myself in the humidity and pitch-black of the tank.
</p>

<p>
  I laid down and lifted my feet up: I was floating! This epsom salt stuff actually worked! With my ears underwater and face sticking out, I remaining static in the water. Opening my eyes made no difference. As I floated there thinking about a variety of things, I began to notice the one noise present in the tank: my heartbeat. Similar to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/anechoic-chamber-worlds-quietest-room/index.html">hearing your heartbeat in the world's quietest room</a>, the combination of pure silence and water enhanced the sound of my heartbeat, quickly making for a not-so-comfortable and incredibly distracting experience.
</p>

<p>
  It quickly went downhill from there. I tried to elevate my head using a provided float, but my ears were still in the water listening to my heartbeat. I weighed my options of staying in for who-knows-how-much-longer or cutting my losses and getting out. I got out.
</p>

<p>
  There wasn't much the spa could have done differently, assuming the water was at the correct temperature. My only other gripe was the limited width of the tank. I found myself hitting the sides every so often, which took away from any trance I or someone else would have gone into. Having a larger, square tank would be helpful for this.
