<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Cool Blues and Cold Brass Balls in the Frigid Night</h2>

<p>
  The trip did not start off as desired, for I was waitlisted—yes, WAITLISTED—at the Capital One Lounge in DFW. The card I pay a high annual fee had two women blocking the entrance taking names and claiming the lounge was full. I begrudgingly put my name down and was called 45 minutes later, giving me a chance to quickly chug some flavored sparkling waters, eat some entrees, and savor the delicious cookies before catching my flight.
</p>

<p>
  The flight was uneventful besides me possibly scarring the five-year-old next to me when he saw the scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Soccer">Shaolin Soccer</a> where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jb2ojrhIuE">fat guy eats an egg out of another dude's mouth</a>. So many questions that I wouldn't have answered had he asked. I landed smoothly, called an $80 Uber and was on my way into the big city all while listening to the driver tell me about the crazy antics he's seen (rich Hampton bros, attempted threesomes in the back seat, super high guys leaving all their stuff in the car while they aimlessly run around yelling—you know, New York typa stuff).
</p>

<p>
  I arrived at my friend E's apartment around 11:15pm and it was on. No lounging around. I was here to explore and by God was I going to. First stop was food: even at midnight there were a helluva lot of pizza places open, and what better way to kick off a NYC strip than a few slices? With my hunger kept at bay for the next hour, it was onwards to <a href="https://www.terrablues.com/">Terra Blues</a>, "a modern-day blues saloon with a second floor view of Bleecker Street in the heart of Greenwich Village". We had a few drinks while enjoying the music and conversation then continued on with our late-night walking tour. I snagged a lamb over rice for $10 cash (side note: cash is m'fin king up here, carry a lot) and ate in the warm of the subway station. We exited near Bowling Green and had to check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_Bull">Charging Bull</a>, and more importantly, touch its balls... you know, for good luck!
</p>

<p>
  We visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Church_(Manhattan)">Trinity Church</a>, a beautifully-constructed church where Alexander Hamilton and a few other prominent early Americans are buried. Weird to think that 200+ years later people are still walking by his bones! A short walk later and I was conked out on a comfy air mattress in a comfortably warm apartment.

  The city felt strange that night. There were almost zero people out, and for good reason: who the heck is out at 3:00am on a Wednesday night? And yet spaces that were normally bustling with activity and the smells of food and sounds of different languages and sights of eccentric and modern fashion were just plain empty. There wasn't a 50-person line waiting to touch the Bull's nuts, nor were pizza shops hustling to serve the dozen customers they had waiting, nor was there any trouble finding a set of seats on the subway with plenty of distance from the crazy person muttering to himself. While I have no idea if this a legitimate word or not, <a href="https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/27720773573/kenopsia">kenopsia</a> fits the feeling pretty well:
</p>

<blockquote>
  the eerie, forlorn atmosphere of a place that’s usually bustling with people but is now abandoned and quiet—a school hallway in the evening, an unlit office on a weekend, vacant fairgrounds—an emotional afterimage that makes it seem not just empty but hyper-empty, with a total population in the negative, who are so conspicuously absent they glow like neon signs.

<h2 id="day2">Day 2: Chasin' and Seein' History</h2>

<p>
  I woke up around 10:00am and was instantly ready for a bagel sandwich. We walked over to Brookfield Place and got rather expensive, yet still rather delicious, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches for sustenance before starting the day. And with that, we started walking. We somehow made it to Times Square for a touristy glimpse at the most famous intersection in America, then continued on to Hell's Kitchen where we noticed something strange given it being mid-morning on a Thursday: there were a lot of kids out and about. Some had backpacks, some didn't, some were with peers, some weren't, some were TikToking, some weren't. We chalked it up to "who cares" and found some Citi bikes to finish up the remaining four miles back to the apartment.
</p>

<p>
  Six miles later of west side scenic riding and fast flybys by desperate delivery riders we were outside of Pace University watching tens of students exit their midday classes. I often think about how or if I'd be different had I grown up in a major city. College me probably wouldn't have found it very interesting given my choice of activities (school, work, and exercise with very little in the way of fun), but who knows—if current me could tell high school me a few things, one of them would be to try harder to get into an urban university. (Not to say I regret my time at a rural university, but all things equal university-wise a city beats out country in most other categories.) Seeing these kids get to live in and go to school in the heart of New York gave me a pang of FOMO.
</p>

<p>
  We met our two other friends, D and A, at the apartment before setting out for the evening. First stop: Applebee's in Times Square. D, E, and another one of their friends supposedly racked up a $600 bar tab of exclusively green tea shots in a single night, and while we weren't planning on besting that, we still want to have a few drinks. That excitement quickly deflated (fart noises included) when it took us 15 minutes to get our first drink. Another 20 minutes brought us to Margaritaville's rooftop bar where we had a couple of margs and enjoyed the expansive view of the city at night.

  Where to next? If you guessed Terra Blues, the exact same blues club we went to the night before, you'd be right. But this time was different: <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/junior-mack/4645">Grammy-nominated Junior Mack</a> was playing. And they played. Hard. Guitar solos galore with a healthy mix of drums and vocals made for some awesome music. Drinks were surprisingly cheap: we downed 15+ and it came out to $144... just another reason to like the club! The people watching there was excellent and pretty representative of NYC in general.

  A late night pizza cap was in order before heading home.

<h2 id="day3">Day 3: Highest in the City</h2>

<p>
  What's a New York breakfast if it doesn't include a bagel sandwich? A and I agreed upon getting two different bagels at <a href="http://www.zuckersbagels.com/">Zucker's</a> and splitting them in half to maximize our taste buds' euphoria. (This practice should be standard for most restaurant outings, especially if it's a new location or cuisine.) I got The Traditional on an everything bagel: "Nova Scotia salmon, plain cream cheese, beefsteak tomatoes, red onions and capers." So. Freaking. Delicious. This further cements my belief that if something sounds even slightly weird but it's still on the menu, try it. It's there for a reason.
</p>

<p>
  After some bickering about downloading an app, D and A got hooked up on bikes and we were off to the races, AKA <a href="https://www.edgenyc.com/en">Edge</a>, AKA the tallest public terrace in New York, AKA vertigoer's nightmare, AKA massive tourist attraction which we absolutely contributed to.

  We took our pictures and headed up to the lounge to relax with a few drinks and enjoy the view a bit more. Tip: if you're up in the lounge, make sure to go to the bathroom directly at the end of the hall. It's without a doubt the best toilet view I've ever experienced (read: paid $50 for). We walked <a href="https://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a>
