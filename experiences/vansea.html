<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Planes, Buses, and Automobiles</h2>

<p>
  My two roommates dropped by off at the airport at 6:00am after a meager four hours of sleep and I was at the gate in less than 10 minutes. The flight was uneventful and consisted of small talk with my seatmates and watching the original Fast and Furious movie.
</p>

<p>
  My proactive research into the DFW-SEA flight path that made me book a starboard window seat paid off well with stunning views of Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and all the forests and meadows surrounding those two. Even as we got closer to Sea-Tac the nature didn't slow down, the civilization was just embedded into it. There were ponds galore, tall trees, and just plain green everywhere for miles and miles. The difference between this and my concrete jungle of a metroplex was stark.
</p>

<p>
  I took the light rail to University Street station and explored around while waiting for my cousin to get there. The other major difference between Seattle and my city? Elevation changes. Downtown Seattle is incredibly hilly. And they're not the gentle rolling ones most grandmas can get up. They're steep, abrupt, and punishing on both the lungs and legs alike. Throw on a heavy-ish backpack and some ill-advised pants and the sweat will quickly start.
</p>

<p>
  I met Cousin at Pike Brewing, where I got a couple of beers and a fish sandwich, both overpriced in absolute terms but both right for the tourist hotspot we were in. He dropped me off at King Street Station a mile south so I could catch my bus up to Vancouver, driven by the most stereotypical Canadian I could think of.

  Vancouver met me with all of its glory: beautiful mountains on the north side, a crazy homeless guy kicking and yelling at a poor, innocent fence, a nice public area with designated bike lanes and water area, and beggars galore. I grabbed a beer and bowl at CRAFT Beer Market False Creek before catching an Uber to my North Vancouver Airbnb and hitting the hay.

<p>
  I was up early to go grab groceries at the local market, followed by a small tea and breakfast roll at a local chain. It was a beautiful, clear day
