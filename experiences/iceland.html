<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Lagoonin' and Laggin'</h2>

<p>
  After a semi-restful plane ride from the States full of "psychotic fast-forwarding" of movies, we touched down in Iceland, land of the green and not the ice as the old elementary school proverb goes. It was cold and windy as expected, biting through my supposed-to-be-waterproof-and-thus-windproof jacket and forcing a reluctant retreat into the carry-on duffel bag for gloves.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.bluelagoon.com/">Blue Lagoon</a> was our first stop. And before we begin, let's be clear that Blue Lagoon's warm spa waters aren't generated by lava or tectonic plates or an army of vikings deep underneath the earth's surface doing manual labor, but a geothermal power plant just up the road, making for a good segue into Iceland's unique energy production and reliance.
</p>

[FINISH ICELAND ENERGY INFO]

<p>
  The Blue Lagoon was a welcome refreshment after our nine hours of flying. The water was warm and sulfur-y, the psuedoscientific (?) face masks droopy and irritating on the bare eyeball, and the free smoothie delicious and refreshing. But it was not as awakening an introduction to Iceland as the $23 we spent on two coffees and a scone at a local mom-and-pop shop on the way into Reykjavik. It felt criminal and exploitative, except I had to remind myself we weren't at a tourist trap and this wasn't coffee branded to be what native Icelanders drink: this was a run-of-the-mill shop and everyone paid these prices, living there or visiting there.
</p>

<p>
  Downtown Reykjavik felt like I expected it to, having been primed by pop culture and the zero Icelandic people I know. It was a cross between a fishing town that realized they had something to offer to tourists and a modern-day European city; the infrastructure was modern, yet the traditional style and ~vibes~ remained in the form of architecture, colors, and lamp meat offerings (which I readily accepted throughout the trip). The hubbub was less frantic than I expected of a capital city, but then again, this wasn't the capital of any ol' country. Iceland isn't as stylish and classy as Paris nor is it as loud and bustling as New York, rather existing somewhere else on the spectrum of cities. I saw no traditional businessmen nor lawyers like I have in New York, no tech bros slapping away on their laptops in the few shops we visited. The locals we saw toiled away about their days in a casual manner, walking slowly with smiles on their faces as they chatted to their companions and enjoyed the frigid (to me) weather.

  [church, not as big as expected like sauron judging them for their sins]
</p>

<p>
  A small snack was had at the renowned hot dog stand BÃ¦jarins Beztu Pylsur for what we, two people hailing from the Kingdom of Hot Dogs and Hot Dog Eaters known as America, both deemed mediocre wieners that were all hype. But hey, some places are for the experience, not the taste.
</p>

<p>
  Dinner consisted of bread and soup bowls at a local joint before heading back to the hotel to sleep off the jet lag. (I woke up in the middle of the night and prayed it was late, only to look in horror at the 9:30pm showing on my phone screen.)
