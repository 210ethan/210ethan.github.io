From an English person that got back from Albania 6 days ago:

Take out cash before you get to Albania and convert it to Lek when you’re there. I couldn’t find anywhere to get Lek in London but in Tirana (and most other cities I’m assuming) there are plenty of places that will convert it for you. Better to use Lek than Euros as things will be more expensive if you pay in Euros. Everything is waaaaay cheaper than in the UK, I only spent £100 in 5 days, and I was eating out for lunch and dinner, spending money on taxis and entrance fees for attractions, plus I bought a couple of souvenirs. I don’t think many places outside the airport and major hotels take card payments, especially not foreign cards.

Every restaurant I came across didn’t need you to stand and wait to be seated at the entrance like they do in the UK. Just go and take a seat and a waiter will come to you.

Learn a few basic words, Albanian is a very difficult language to master but the locals really appreciate it if you start with a few words of Albanian. Things like Hello, thank you, how are you, please, that kind of thing. Most Albanians can speak English in my experience, especially younger people. Also a lot of people speak Italian, if you know that.

Albanians are super hospitable, like they go to a level above and beyond anything else I’ve ever experienced, and I’m decently well travelled in Europe. For example, my tour guide was dropping me off back at my hotel after our tour was finished, and he had to go to his job, but offered to have his wife drive me around for free if I wanted. People in the streets would often directly take me to somewhere after I asked them for directions. The cynical English in me told me they must be doing something nefarious, but no, they really are that nice.

Albanian food is great, especially the meat. Try the traditional dishes, ask for recommendations from the locals. For me it was kind of similar to Italian and Greek cuisine, with a slight twist. Dishes you have to try while you’re there are byrek, kebab and baklava. Not the greatest place for vegetarians though.

Albania is quite a small country so if you want to see all the major cities in a short time, you can. I wouldn’t recommend driving yourself though, local tour guides are relatively cheap and make it a lot easier for yourself. Albanians have quite a liberal approach to driving, especially in the cities, lol.

Don’t drink the tap water.

When crossing roads and there’s not a traffic light, you just have to go for it. The cars will not stop for you if you just wait on the edge of the pavement. This took me a while to understand, lol.

If you go to Tirana, they have a free walking tour twice a day which is a really good starting point to get a feel for the city. They introduce you to the main attractions and give you the historical and cultural story of the city.

Tirana is super safe, I am a solo female traveller and I never felt like I was in danger. Of course you should use common sense and don’t carry lots of cash or valuable items like your passport on you all the time, and probably best not to wear flashy clothes and jewellery, but this goes for travelling anywhere. I didn’t encounter any pickpockets or tourist scams while I was there.

The public transport is a little confusing, information isn’t available on Google Maps or any other transport app that I looked up. It is very cheap and decently regular though, at least in Tirana. If you need help planning a journey, you can just ask at your hotel or the bus driver. I only got the bus a few times but it was very cheap, 40 lek a journey which is like 30p. I can’t speak for transiting from city to city using public transport as I never did it, but again you could just ask for help at your hotel.

The best time to go is probably spring or autumn. In the summer Albania can get unbearably hot (like 40° celsius) and that’s also peak season, so all the tourist attractions will be crowded. I went in early November and the weather was still nice (sunny, usually low 20s in the day and a little chilly at night but not too bad).

Be respectful, like you would in any country. Don’t bring up politics, especially communism or the Kosovo situation. Vast majority of Albanians are very tolerant about religion though, which is really cool.
