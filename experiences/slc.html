<h2 id="day1">Day 1: Downtown and Around Town</h2>

<p>
  After leaving work questionably early to hit the airport lounge and load up on a gourmet mini entrees and desserts, I hopped on the plane and landed a few hours later in the rather strange Salt Lake Valley. Why strange? I've never seen anything like it geographically. To the south and east were lush, green mountains that were fairly prominent; to the north and west was the Great Salt Lake and expansive salt flats. I now understand why Brigham Young chose this spot. Any shorter and he'd be in steep terrain, any further and he'd be in a salty desert.

<p>
  My friend, C, picked me up to head downtown to <a href="https://www.whiskeystreet.com/">Whiskey Street</a>, a cocktail bar and restaurant that turned out to offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappy_Van_Winkle%27s_Family_Reserve">Pappy Van Winkle's 23 Year</a>. Now I would never buy a glass of it given the $400 price tag attached, but it's fun to show a few friends who are aware of its rarity "hey, look! I found a Pappy offering in the wild!". I had a delicious Cuban sandwich with a side salad and two thirst-quenching Hefeweizens.
</p>

<p>
  Next up was a driving tour of the Valley. C drove me to his workplace via the "scenic route", a road that went past many mountain bikers of all ages and genders—children, teenagers, adults, and even weathered veterans—heading to the trails for late afternoon rides. We passed at least three awesome-looking trails along the way, and we were only driving for 20 minutes! 20 minutes barely gets me to the highway in my city, much less miles of singletrack.

  We crashed early-ish with the sun still setting on the horizon.

<p>
  Breakfast consisted of a large scramble and three pancakes at Big Bear Diner, a national chain that extends at least as far as Texas.
</p>

<p>
  We picked up my camping rental gear—sleeping pad, sleeping bag, tent, and poles—and some other miscellaneous items at the local REI before heading to Snowbird
</p>

<p>
  the grocery store for that night's dinner and tomorrow's fuel for the hike. All-in-all my food was looking to be burgers and chips for dinner, then Clif Bars, Gu, and trail mix throughout the day. Impeccable nutrition.

<p>
  Packing was finished around
