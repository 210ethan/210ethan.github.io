<p>
  Mark Twight is the most influential person in my life. More than any family member, more than any friend. I had developed a philosophy about life before stumbling across his, but his helped me refine and add to mine to make it what it is today. He taught me other ways to live, ways that I had trivially thought about before but never actually abided by. His writings made me confront things about myself that I had ignored or shrugged off as normal and acceptable in today's society—others do this, so why is it a problem if I do? He taught me how to live by a personal standard that is separate from the (lower) standards of others; to strive to meet the goals that I set and suffer the consequences if I don't; to truly commit with my word, always follow through, and never say what I don't actually mean, whether it involves action (talk minus action equals zero) or not.
</p>

<p>
  Twight wrote an essay—called a Sunday Sermon—every week at his old project and published the collection in <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/shop/p/poison-special">Poison: Sermons on Suffering</a>. These are my reflections on those essays.

  Twight has written extensively how difficult shared experiences bonded him so closely to his climbing partners—being that close to death has that type of effect. I think shared suffering does the same, and if you want to get closer, intentionally suffering together (in a good way!) is helpful in doing so. Coming out on the other side both better and together is not insignificant.
</p>

<p>
  Do most people have a purpose in life? Does being a parent count? What about a menial employee? Maybe in some sense, but not in the way Twight is talking about. His was climbing, mine is yet to be determined. I've found purposes, but not "THE thing that speaks to the heart of us, without interpretation, directly". I've dabbled in a variety of physical disciplines out of boredom and interest and nostalgia and continue to search for something that grabs and holds my attention for a long time. I don't know whether it's me as a person and I'll never find it or if it's still out there, lying in wait. Maybe it's the more general umbrella of self-improvement and the disciplines are just ways to realize the philosophy.
