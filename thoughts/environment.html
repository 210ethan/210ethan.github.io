  <b>I</b>

<p>
  One method of improving aerobic endurance is polarized training. Athletes spend 75-80% of their training volume in zone 1 (Z1) and 20% of their time in Z3. Z1 is very easy effort, while Z3 is very hard effort.
</p>

<p>
  Z1 looks embarrassingly easy to passerby. If most people saw a cyclist decked out in a sponsored kit and five-figure-dollar-sign bike doing Z1 work and didn't know about polarized training, they'd scoff at them for being an obvious poser. But it's been proven to work, and as a wise person once said, most people probably don't go easy enough on their easy days.
