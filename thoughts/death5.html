  I often wonder how much of an influence my father had into me becoming the person I am today. People will occasionally tell me I do this just like him or a trait of mine reminds me of them, but only in the most obvious cases can I tell if it's a genuine observation and not some statement meant to make me feel better about my half-orphan status. I don't think my father influenced me as much as most fathers do their children; I was a moody, rebellious teenager hellbent on defying his wishes and making him see things my way, the right way. He tried to teach me things—life lessons and basic carpentry and manners and more—and while some of them stuck, I had already agreed with the lessons beforehand, no instruction or coaxing required. (Not to say I'm the smartest boy to ever live, just that the information often fell on ears that had already heard it.) I get surprised reactions when I tell others this, like I'm disrespecting his memory or saying something sacriligeous.

<p>
  And speaking poorly—not in a smack-talking, derogatory manner, but a "this and that were problems" way about the dead is something that should absolutely be allowed. My father was a good man, but he had his flaws and I was often the first to point them out.
</p>

<p>
  I've had countless people tell me "oh, he was so proud of you" and "he loved you".

  I used to feel like I was missing out when my friends' fathers were involved in some festivity
