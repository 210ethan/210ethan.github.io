  I'm currently sitting in an international airport still surrounded by signs reminding travelers to wear masks. My employer has mandated vaccines and fired those who refused to comply (and didn't qualify for an exemption). I've started hearing stories of businesses requiring proof of vaccination to enter. Mass protests have erupted across the globe advocating against vaccine mandates. Some coworkers haven't set foot in the office since they were sent home in March 2020, yet remain just as productive as the pre-C19 era.

<p>
  Oh, how the world has changed in just a few short years.
</p>

<p>
  But how am <i>I</i> affected? I'm double vaxxed and boosted. I work from home every once in a while. I've started wearing my mask again after U.S. cases spiked due to Omicron.
