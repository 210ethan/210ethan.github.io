<h1 id="safe">Safer (Read: Better) Driving</h1>

<p>
  Like the other 90% of the population, I'm in the top 10% of drivers.
</p>

<p>
  This post was made out of anger at other drivers, and while I won't be <a href="https://worldation.com/stories/funniest-creative-windshield-notes-ever-left-cars-nttb/#:~:text=Hellen%20Kellering%20it,than%20referring%20to%20someone's%20disability.&text=And%20in%20this%20case%2C%20it%20can%20actually%20be%20considered%20a%20compliment.">leaving a note with a link to this on someone's windshield</a>, I hope someone does reevaluate their driving behaviors after reading this or think about their current driving style.
</p>

<h2 id="golden_rules">Golden Rules</h2>

<p>
  First, I would like to go over my so-called "golden rules" of driving: be predictable and follow the law (to a reasonable extent).
</p>

<h3 id="be_predictable">Be Predictable</h3>

<p>
  Being predictable allows other drivers to anticipate your actions and base their actions on what they think you're going to do. Using a turn signal allows cars behind you to slow down; following right-of-way rules leaves little room for confusion, thus little room for accidents.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to note that being nice does not always translate to predictable. Someone waiting to turn left across traffic? Sorry, pal, you're gonna have to wait, because letting them in is not predictable. I promise that person isn't going to get mad at you, and good karma won't come your way.
</p>

<h3 id="follow_law">Follow the Law (to a Reasonable Extent)</h3>

<p>
  Laws are in place for a reason. (I'll ignore the smartasses who argue the opposite.) Speed limits are to prevent us from going too fast, improper lane changes are to ensure we stick to our lane during appropriate times, and so on.

<h2 id="cognitive_biases">Cognitive Biases</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4e80uu/traffic_engineers_is_there_any_way_i_can_alter_my/d1y78fb/">u/wbeaty's comment</a> on improving individual driving to improve traffic is a great summary of why traffic is:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A recent one is this: yes, a single driver can maintain constant speed; wiping out the growing waves which propagate backwards through the chain. But sometimes this doesn't work 100%. A better algorithm discovered ?2013? is to also monitor the driver directly behind your car, and to use your empty gap to speed up whenever the car behind you is approaching too fast. This tends to damp any large fluctuations commonly produced by an inattentive driver directly behind. Don't be like a solid wall, instead be like a dashpot. Perform this trick at the same time as the known task of absorbing the waves coming from ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    An older technique (long known to professional truckers) is to never close up your gap, never try to "block cheaters" or "punish interlopers" or any of that stuff. Instead, always encourage free merging. Try to get people to jump into the gap ahead of you. And, if a huge backup appears in one lane, the proper thing to do is to use the empty lane, and to merge in one place only: at the last minute. (Or, if you must merge early, then maintain a large gap in the through-lane, making late-merging possible.) Traffic often behaves like merging gear-teeth, and to keep the gears spinning requires empty spaces. The modern term for this is "do the zipper." Several state DOTs have started publicity campaigns about Zipper Merging.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's another from traffic physics: the optimum algorithms for highway driving are very different than those for in-city driving where traffic lights are present. For example, when we're down in the city-grid, if we maintain large gaps, then the next red light will block our progress. Or worse, we'll be pushing a whole column of traffic back into a red light; traffic which could have made it through. In the city-grid, a certain amount of tailgating is required, and big gaps may greatly reduce the flow. But on highways without red lights, it all works backwards. Without the traffic signals to pace the flow, large jams can spontaneously arise from nothing. The jams require an environment of aggressive tailgating before they can form. These jams can be partially thwarted by "anti-tailgaters," by drivers who maintain large forward gaps, and who drive at constant speed in order to prevent fluctuations from growing. Also, the large gaps will promote "zipper" or "gear teeth" rapid driving through merge-zones.
  </p>
  <p>
    A less cutting-edge driving technique involves psychology. Observe congested traffic accurately, and eliminate all the myths and emotional bias which distorts our perceptions as drivers. A big one is this: each car on the road is actually a delay of only 1-2 seconds. It's nothing like a line at the grocery cash register. If a car merges into your gap, will you be late to work? What if ten cars jump in ahead of you, O the Humanity! :) Nope, even if 60 cars get ahead, that only delays you by a minute or two. Such a small a delay is insignificant for most commutes. It's down in the noise, a tiny fluctuation. Compared to a line at the grocery checkout, one shopping cart equals 50 to 200 cars ahead of you on the highway. But it doesn't feel that way! We all seem to be trapped in a delusional time-warp during commutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we aggressively pass three other cars during congestion, it feels as if we're shortening our commute-time. Wrong, because if we want to genuinely shorten our commute, we'd have to drive a few MPH faster than average. Our position in line means nothing, when compared to actually driving faster. For example, on a half-hour commute, if we could drive 2MPH faster than everyone else, we'd have passed an entire mile worth of cars in the chain. So, if you fight like fury and manage to pass ten other drivers, twenty other drivers ...that's nothing. Instead you could have set your alarm clock 1min earlier in the morning, which puts you ahead by roughly sixty cars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or, here's another way to view this: if you walk onto the subway, or on a bus, should you try rushing to the front? Elbow everyone aside, knock down kids and old ladies? After all, each passenger ahead of you at the bus door might cause an entire second of delay. Yet when riding on the bus, there's no delusional time-warp. We don't usually have several other passengers viciously fighting for the seat closest to the front. If someone ever does shoulder their way to the front of the vehicle while crowing about how skilled and superior they are at bus-riding, the driver will stop the bus and call for the men in white coats! So: if you wouldn't do it on the bus, don't do it while highway commuting. When you're in rush hour, you're not in a road race. Instead, admit to the fact that you're "trapped on a bus," and if you take your seat and stop fighting with other commuters, then like magic the whole bus goes much faster.

<p>
  Let's examine it paragraph-by-paragraph.
</p>

<h3 id="invisible_bumper_cars">Invisible Bumper Cars</h3>

<p>
  This is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_wave">traffic waves</a>, as seen in the video below. Note the black car in the 7-o'clock position at the 0:07 mark. It gets too close to the white car in front of it and is forced to slow down. This singular event causes the so-called wave, affecting many cars throughout the circle.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Suugn-p5C1M" class="center"></iframe>

<p>
  If the white car had <a href="#safe_following_distance">more space in front of it</a> (I understand there is limited space within the circle) and sped up after seeing the black getting too close, the wave likely would not have occurred at that time.

<h3 id="zipper_merging">Zipper Merging, or Why You Should Be a Selfish [Expletive]</h3>

<p>
  By getting into the non-merging lane sooner, this lengthens the line of cars in lane, causing traffic further down the road. I am not able to find literature detailing the efficiency increase in cars/time, but the logic is there.
</p>

<h3 id="passing">Passing, or How Going 5 MPH Over Doesn't Really Save You Time</h3>

<p>
  First, let's look at some basic numbers for different trip distances and speeds. A trip of 5 mi takes 6.7 min at 45 mph, but only 6.0 min at 50 mph. This saves all of 40 seconds. The time savings decrease the faster you go at a constant distance.
</p>

<img src="media/passing.png" alt="passing" class="center">

<p>
  On top of going over the speed limit (which is unsafe), gas is being used at a unproportional rate compared to slower speeds. <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/">MPG For Speed</a> claims:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      3% less efficient at 60 mph
    </li>
    <li>
      8% less efficient at 65 mph
    </li>
    <li>
      17% less efficient at 70 mph
    </li>
    <li>
      23% less efficient at 75 mph
    </li>
    <li>
      28% less efficient at 80 mph
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Plugging in actual numbers of 30 mpg, 100 highway miles, and $2.50/gal, the following table is found:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th align="middle">Speed</th><th align="middle">Daily Travel Time</th><th align="middle">Effective MPG</th><th align="middle">Cost/day</th><th align="middle">Cost/year</th>
    <tr align="middle"><td>55 MPH</td><td>109 min.</td><td>30.0</td><td>$8.33</td><td>$3,040.45</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>60 MPH</td><td>100 min.</td><td>29.1</td><td>$8.59</td><td>$3,135.35</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>65 MPH</td><td>92 min.</td><td>27.6</td><td>$9.06</td><td>$3,306.90</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>70 MPH</td><td>86 min.</td><td>24.9</td><td>$10.04</td><td>$3,664.60</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>75 MPH</td><td>80 min.</td><td>23.1</td><td>$10.82</td><td>$3,949.30</td></tr>
    <tr align="middle"><td>80 MPH</td><td>75 min.</td><td>21.6</td><td>$11.57</td><td>$4,223.05</td></tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<blockquote>
  Your bottom line: If you normally travel at 75 mph, you could be saving yourself $813.95 per year if you drove at 60mph - and you'd only be making your total commute 20 minutes longer.

<h2 id="behaviors">Behaviors</h2>



<h3 id="proprioception">Proprioception</h3>

<p>
  Proprioception is the "perception or awareness of the position and movement of the body". In the context of driving, it's the awareness of the position of the car on the road, both relative to the road itself and other drivers.
</p>

<p>
  Knowing how far your car stretches in all four directions allows you to know how much room you have in any direction to move.
</p>



<h3 id="distractions">Distractions</h3>

<p>
  Next time you are driving, close your eyes for a second or two on a busy road. This is effectively what texting and driving is: driving blind. Sure, peripheral vision is available, but it's not trustworthy.
</p>








<h3 id="substances">Substances</h3>

<h4 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h4>

<p>
  Nothing needs to be said on this. Any amount of alcohol impairs you and your ability to drive. Driving and alcohol do not mix, no matter the quantity or type.
</p>

<h4 id="illegal_substances">Illegal Substances</h4>

<p>
  Marijuana, cocaine, etc. should not be used prior to driving.
</p>

<h4 id="caffeine">Caffeine</h4>

<p>
  Caffeine has been shown to improve driving performance.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3382640/">Effects of coffee on driving performance during prolonged simulated highway driving</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The results showed that caffeinated coffee significantly reduced SDLP [standard deviation of lateral position, or the intralane movement] as compared to decaffeinated coffee, both in the first (p = 0.024) and second hour (p = 0.019) after the break. Similarly, the standard deviation of speed (p = 0.024; p = 0.001), mental effort (p = 0.003; p = 0.023), and subjective sleepiness (p = 0.001; p = 0.002) were reduced in both the first and second hour after consuming caffeinated coffee. Subjective driving quality was significantly improved in the first hour after consuming caffeinated coffee (p = 0.004).

</p>

<blockquote>
  On a computerised task measuring sustained attention, participants who consumed caffeine demonstrated greater performance accuracy. Furthermore, on a driving simulator task benefits were also observed, with participants performing fewer steering wheel movements, making for a safer, accurate and more stable drive, compared with the decaffeinated condition.

<h3 id="safe_following_distance">Safe Following Distance (SFD)</h3>

<p>
  SFD is taught in every driver's education course across the country, yet I constantly see it violated on the highway. On top of that, it's sense (I leave the "common" out, because it's not-so-common). The standard SFD is measured in time, not length: <a href="https://www.aarp.org/auto/driver-safety/info-2013/safe-following-distance.html">three seconds</a>.
</p>

<p>
  SFD is based on a few things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Reaction Time: Some people are simply faster at reacting to change. Slower reaction times means a larger SFD.
  </li>
  <li>
    Speed: Faster speeds mean more distance is covered per unit time and keeping reaction time constant. Faster speeds means a larger SFD.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conditions: Slick roads will cause the car to travel more distance with the same amount of braking power. Less ideal conditions (rain, snow, ice) means a larger SFD.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  And can be calculated fairly simply (depending on how you define reaction time, the "time to press brake" variable may be irrelevant):
</p>

\[\text{Stopping distance} = \text{(reaction time + time to press brake)} \times \text{speed} + \text{braking distance}\]

<p>
  Here's a simple scenario: You are driving 72 mi/h = 106 ft/s (sorry, non-American readers) on a dry road in a regular sedan. The vehicle in front of you is only 2 seconds ahead (106 ft/s &#215; 2 = 212 ft) and suddenly crashes into a stopped vehicle, instantly stopping. Are you able to stop in time to avoid hitting the vehicle ahead of you?
</p>

<p>
  In his paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233039156_Brake_Reaction_Times_and_Driver_Behavior_Analysis">Brake Reaction Times and Driver Behavior Analysis</a>, Summala finds that average time is 1.0-1.3 s. Let's give you the benefit of the doubt and make calculating this disaster easy: your reaction time is 1.0 s. Based on <a href="https://nacto.org/docs/usdg/vehicle_stopping_distance_and_time_upenn.pdf">this table</a>, the braking distance ("Braking Deceleration Distance") at 106 ft/s is 248 ft. In summary:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Initial distance to crash: 212 ft
  </li>
  <li>
    Distance to crash after applying brake (reaction time &#215; speed): 106 ft
  </li>
  <li>
    Distance to crash after braking is finished (distance after applying brake - braking distance): -142 ft
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In short, you're fucked a second before impact, and there's literally nothing you can do about it&mdash;no swerving, no jumping, no miracles. The appropriate following time based on these conditions is 354 ft, or 3.44 s, and that's in excellent conditions with a superb reaction time! Yeah, right.
</p>

<p>
  I use 3 seconds for 0-45 mph, 4 seconds for 45-60 mph, and 5+ seconds for 60+ mph. These times also give the driver behind you adequate time to slow down since you don't have to slow down as quickly.
