<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I always had an inkling about the "flavor" of my posts. While they are my thoughts and no one else's (this doesn't count influence), they often include a final section with a title that is synonymous to the word "recommendation". (And that's if the entire post isn't advice in and of itself.) My one-on-one partner directly pointed this out, bringing it out in the open and making me take a step back and understand why I tend to provide recommendations. It's not conscious. I rarely actively think that I <i>need</i> to recommend something to someone—it just happens. Is this a personality trait? Something else? Let's find out.

<h2 id="perspective">Perspective</h2>

<p>
  I greatly value unique perspectives. Given two identical candidates for a job—one who is similar to the people already on the job and another who is vastly different—I'd choose the latter all day. Unique perspectives encourage a more holistic view of situations, more comprehensive knowledge on a certain subject, more thought-provoking moments that allow one's current perspective to be tweaked or shifted or updated based on the newest input.
</p>

<p>
  And I firmly believe I provide unique perspectives. <a href="boredom.html">Boredom</a>, <a href="seo.html">Against SEO</a>, and <a href="pacing1.html">Pacing I: Deceleration</a>, among others, preach philosophies I hold that I haven't explicitly seen or heard anywhere else. I say explicitly because people surely abide by these, but others may not notice—putting the thoughts into written words directly gets the point across with minimal interpretation issues.
</p>

<p>
  If someone doesn't find my thoughts unique or noteworthy, great. They wasted a bit of their life and no update was needed. But if someone does find my thoughts unique and or noteworthy, even better. They can update their philosophies and continue on with their life.
