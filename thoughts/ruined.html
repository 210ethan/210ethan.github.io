  Has trying to get better made me worse?

  [name] has a had a profound impact on me. I don't consider myself a fanboy because I don't obsess about him as a person, but rather his philosphy, which boils down to a few main points:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do what you say you're going to do
  </li>
  <li>
    You are capable of more than you think you are
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't (fucking) quit
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue growing
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of these have taken longer for me to implement into my life, but they're all there now, regularly being practiced and refined. I hold myself accountable for following through on commitments and promises. I regularly push my comfort level to remind myself of what I'm capable of. I only quit when it doesn't make sense for me to continue. I seek growth in all aspects of my life.
</p>

<p>
  But it appears others rarely follow these principles. They make empty promises. They don't care about where their limits are, much less pushing past them. They quit when things get challenging. They are complacent with where they're at in life, whether it be professionally or athletically or socially.
</p>

<p>
  And I often disdain them for it.
</p>

<p>
  I abhor those who tell me they'll do something and make no obvious effort to actually do it. I pity those who do not search for their limits. I am annoyed by those who quit at the slightest experience of discomfort. I am disgusted by those who don't seek to better themselves in some fashion.
</p>

<p>
  I know this comes across as condescending, elitist, and derogatory. The saving grace of these four principles is they apply to many aspects of life and can be practiced by most, nature or nurture factors aside. I do not ask for a 99th-percentile rating in all of them. I just want honest effort put into at least one or two.

  Arrhenius is an engineer who doesn't have much going on his lifeâ€”no significant other, no hobbies, little family. But he enjoys his job. He meets all the deadlines he sets for himself, even if that means staying late to finish. He takes on large, complex projects that he and others are doubtful he can do by himself, but still manages to finish on time and with superb quality, never choosing to quit when he hits a seemingly-impassable obstacle. He continues to learn his craft and those that support it in order to improve his own skills.

  Brantiorio is a EVE online gamer with a dead-end job. He's not very good at EVE. He doesn't understand large-scale battle strategy and often fails to do well in smaller battles where individual performance matters more. But he's reliable. And his teammates know both of these facts. They put him in positions that are crucial to the success of the army yet don't require great skill or apply immense, real-time pressure. He works hard to fulfill his role and contribute to the team, never shying away from or altogether leaving the boredom because he knows everyone is dependent on him. There is no growth or pushing past limits for Brandenburg. He is satisfied where he's at as a reliable, follow-things-through-to-the-end teammate.

<p>
