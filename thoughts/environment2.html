<p>
  One method of improving aerobic endurance is polarized training. Athletes spend 75-80% of their training volume in zone 1 (Z1) and 20% of their time in Z3. Z1 is very easy effort, while Z3 is very hard effort.
</p>

<p>
  Z1 looks embarrassingly easy to passerby. If most people saw a cyclist decked out in a sponsored kit and five-figure-dollar-sign bike doing Z1 work and didn't know about polarized training they'd scoff at them for being an obvious poser. But it's been proven to work, and as a wise person once said, most people probably don't go easy enough on their easy days. Z3 looks cool and challenging to passerby. If most people saw a cyclist decked out in a sponsored kit and five-figure-dollar-sign bike doing Z3 work they'd assume the rider was hard-working and in great shape. Many riders are able to tap into unknown stores of energy when others are watching, and Z3 efforts can use all the extra power possible.
</p>

<p>
  Z1 should be done where no one can see and Z3 should be done where everyone can see.

  Distractions, whether active (in the form of a person, noises, etc) or passive (in the form of other optional activities, things to look at, etc) are abundant in most environments and tend to inhibit productivity. If productivity is the goal, remove any and all possible distractions so only the work at hand can be focused on. Find a group or partner to hold each other accountableâ€”if focus wanes, the other(s) bring it back on track.
