  Experiences and lessons after suddenly and unexpectedly losing my father.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  My father died suddenly and unexpectedly after a heart attack on the morning of 19 September 2020. I got a text from a family friend, called the friend, and was urged to come back to my hometown immediately. At the end of the 300-mile drive I was greeted by my mother at the front door and the words "Dad's gone".
</p>

<p>
  My mind went blank. I didn't know what to think. I had spent the 4-hour drive going back and forth between positive and negative thoughts: he's fine, he must have just broken a few bones; they're performing CPR on him, so it must be bad; he's one of the healthiest people I know, there must be a mistake; I haven't gotten a phone call yet, and I definitely would get one if he was okay because my mother knows that I'd be driving fast, so things are not okay. But those two words confirmed one of my absolute worst fears: one of my parents was dead.
</p>

<p>
  The worst part was the suddenness. He had just texted the family a picture that morning and I had spoken to him two days earlier. There were no warning signs or any indication that something like this was going to or even could happen. Sure, he had high cholesterol, but he exercised almost every day by running, mountain biking, or calisthenics. How could it happen to <i>him</i>?
</p>

<p>
  It was and still is—9 days after the fact—difficult to process. The person that raised me over the course of 23 years is no longer there, never to return. I will never talk to him on my way home from work like I did all those times during my college years; I'll never ride mountain bikes with him on the trails near my childhood home; I'll receive no more knowledge or wisdom in preparation for my adult life. He's completely gone, and that's something I'll have to accept and learn to live with.

  The untimeliness was poor in another aspect: I had just moved 4 hours away to begin my new career. I had only finished my first week when I got the fateful call. This affected not only me, but my mother. I was now even more alone in Dallas (I have few friends up here and my COVID-19 risk tolerance is quite low, effectively preventing me from developing new friendships) and my parents had just recently become legitimate <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empty%20nester">empty nesters</a>. With my father gone, my mother was completely alone (sans our dog).
