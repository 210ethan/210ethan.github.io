  So-called fitness gurus on YouTube post clickbait bullshit claiming how these three "magic exercises" will increase gainz tenfold while also not requiring any extra recovery and allowing a care-free diet, despite knowing that the average viewer isn't knowledgable enough about training to know this isn't doesn't actually work. They include a link to their paid e-book that details even more "training secrets" and shitty plans, yet conveniently fail to include the fact that they've been training consistently for 10 years with excellent recovery procedures and a superb diet.

  Duolingo has gamified language learning to increase the likelihood users continue to use the product. It does a good job of improving reading and writing, but the listening and speaking skills attained are lackluster. Users think that Duolingo is all they need to do in order to achieve the B2 or C1, when in reality these levels practically necessitate complete immersion in the target language. They must constantly listen to the language and make attempts to speak it, both of which require a significant amount of brain power and are rarely, if ever, fun in the beginning stages of struggle and self-doubt. But the fun, sexy Duolingo steers users clear of the boring, yet rewarding, struggle and towards pastures spray-painted green.

  There are hundreds of paid online courses that teach various investment strategies involving real estate, securities, etc. TikTok influencers give out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0yImDNJs-s">investment advice</a> to a likely impressionable audience with no consequence. r/wallstreetbets exist, arguably one of the most exciting (in the most neutral sense of the word!) subreddits. All of these promise incredible returns that boring ol' index funds pale in comparison to. Why be bored and poor when being excited and rich is just as easy?

  Commercial weight loss programs tout that this food or that drink need not be given up to make progressâ€”weight loss can still be delicious and effective! But these programs fail to mention that losing weight is almost always hard work. It's not glamorous. It's not sexy. It's not fun. It's hunger and irritability and saying no and counting and being conscientious of decisions. Of course, no one wants to hear this. They want to hear exactly what the mainstream programs are saying. They want to believe that it can be easy and work. There is no such thing as a free lunch and this is no exception.

  The common theme amongst all of the above examples is the promise that the journey will be easy and the objective still accomplished. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride towards the goal, no discomfort required.

<p>
  Anyone who has ever pursued a goal in fitness, career, language learning, investing, or weight loss knows it is not easy. Getting fit requires pain and consistency. Career progression requires long hours and thought-out, strategic decisions. Language learning involves large volumes of deliberate studying and practicing. Investing can be easy from an effort standpoint, but is often drawn out over many years or decades before the benefits are reaped. Weight loss involves prolonged hunger and defying social pressure. None of these are easy. The process is arduous and filled with self-doubt as to whether the goal is misguided.
