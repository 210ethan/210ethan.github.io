  So-called fitness gurus on YouTube post clickbait bullshit claiming how these three "magic exercises" will increase gainz tenfold while also not requiring any extra recovery and allowing a care-free diet, despite knowing that the average viewer isn't knowledgable enough about training to know this isn't doesn't actually work. They include a link to their paid e-book that details even more "training secrets" and shitty plans, yet conveniently fail to include the fact that they've been training consistently for 10 years with excellent recovery procedures and a superb diet.

  Duolingo has gamified language learning to increase the likelihood users continue to use the product. It does a good job of improving reading and writing, but the listening and speaking skills attained are lackluster. Users think that Duolingo is all they need to do in order to achieve the B2 or C1, when in reality these levels practically necessitate complete immersion in the target language. They must constantly listen to the language and make attempts to speak it, both of which require a significant amount of brain power and are rarely, if ever, fun in the beginning stages of struggle and self-doubt. But the fun, sexy Duolingo steers users clear of the boring, yet rewarding, struggle and towards pastures spray-painted green.

  There are hundreds of paid online courses that teach various investment strategies involving real estate, securities, etc. TikTok influencers give out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0yImDNJs-s">investment advice</a> to a likely impressionable audience with no consequence. r/wallstreetbets exist, arguably one of the most exciting (in the most neutral sense of the word!) subreddits. All of these promise incredible returns that boring ol' index funds pale in comparison to. Why be bored and poor when being excited and rich is just as easy?
