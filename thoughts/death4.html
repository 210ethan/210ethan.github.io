  I came very close to losing, or at least severely damaging, my oldest friendship. My life flashed before my eyes both as I prepared for the fateful discussion and, admittedly, during it. All the memories I had made with them played across the movie projector that were my eyes, forcing nostalgia down my throat and tears into my eyes. We had grown up together since first grade, calling each other best friends almost immediately after meeting each other and practically ever since. Our families grew close, taking care of each other as needed when times were rough and appreciating each other when times were fruitful and merry.

  Yet here I was, standing on the edge of a precipice, knowing that if I drop in I might not be able to make it back, that the relationship would be forever altered. The choice was clear, the risk palpable, the dread overbearing.
</p>

<p>
  A question crossed my mind as I practiced the conversation to myself: is losing a friend the same as them dying?
</p>

<p>
  In some ways, absolutely yes. For one, there is no more talking, no more
