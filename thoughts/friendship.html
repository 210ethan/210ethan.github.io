  In the span of about two weeks I've found that my three closest coworkers are leaving their current roles for other positions at the company. J, who has been my cubemate for the past year, will practically be gone in two months. C, who I've gone on multiple trips with, is leaving the state in two months. S, who I've gone on the same trips with, has no timeline, but it will also be soon. And just like that, I'll be all alone. The rest of our friend group are coupled/engaged/married, making it a bit strange for me to fifth-wheel with them.
