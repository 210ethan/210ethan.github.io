  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Alejandro is just getting into bouldering and progressing quickly. He's already on V3 problems that some people who have been bouldering for much longer still have trouble with. A video shows up on his YouTube feed of a V6 problem at a local gym and he decides to head out there the next day to try it out. It can't be <i>that</i> difficult.
</p>

<p>
  Alejandro can't even get off the ground. He tries to lift his feet but his grip immediately fails. A $20 day pass for nothing. He hangs his head in shame and heads back to his home gym, back to those lame V3 problems.
</p>

<p>
  It's been a year and Alejandro is now on V6 problems. A video shows up on his YouTube feed of a V7+ problem at a local gym and he decides to head out there the next day to try it out. It can't be <i>that</i> difficult.
</p>

<p>
  Alejandro can't even get off the ground. He tries to lift his feet but his grip immediately fails. This all-too-familiar feeling refreshes his memory to a year ago, when he grossly underestimated the difficult of the V6 he can now climb successfully most of the time.

  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Brianna is an intermediate lifter and can deadlift 100 kg for a few reps. She's hungry for success and has a goal of pulling 150 kg in the next two years. The first year passes and she's added 20 kg. The first half of the second year passes and she's added an additional 5 kg. The second year passes and she's at 132 kg for one rep. Meh, this took a bit longer than expected. She chalks it up to not training hard enough and adjusts her 150 kg goal out another year.
</p>

<p>
  The third year passes and she's at 140 kg, despite training harder than ever.
</p>

  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  Charlie has an 1800 ELO rating and loves chess. He practices for two hours a day: one hour of free play against other online players and one hour of studying theory. He doesn't have a goal setâ€”he just wants to be a solid chess player, so around 2300-2400 or so. But progress begins to wane. The same input of two hours per day doesn't match the output of earlier days: learning is more difficult, the strategies more complex, the opponents less forgiving. He increases practice to three hours per day with a marginal improvement.
</p>

<p>
  Charlie's read about it taking five or more years to reach 2400 and another few to reach 2500, but he didn't think it applied to <i>him</i>.

<h2 id="dunning_kruger">Dunning-Kruger Relation</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> states that "people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of a task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge". While this is exemplified in many ways and disciplines, it's worth looking at the mechanism by which this occurs.
