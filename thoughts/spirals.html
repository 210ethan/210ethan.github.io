  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Howard is incredibly productive throughout the year only to receive a poor end-of-year performance review for irrational reasons. His unproductive-compared-to-him peers received similar raises. The lesson has been learned: actual productivity doesn't correlate with ratings. Howard begins to slack off, choosing to take two hour lunches, leaving early, and only working on what makes his life better. The next year's review is similar to his last, putting him deeper into the attitude hole and perpetuating the cycle further.

<p>
  Ellsworth has been exercising for months in an attempt to improve his physique and general health, but progress is lacking. He's tried Orangetheory, spin classes, a personal trainer, and good ol' jogging. A friend suggests lifting weights due to the fast feedback loops experienced at the beginner stages. Ellsworth is shocked at the results: he is able to progress weight lifted almost every session, increasing his motivation to continue lifting. Strength progress is a bit slower one year later, but his physique has improved enough that others have commented their positive thoughts.

<p>
  Dominique meets up with a friend and it's a bit awkward after the friend says something socially wrong, resulting in the relationship's <a href="inertia.html">social inertia</a> decreasing. The next interaction is more awkward, causing both Dominique and friend to avoid seeing each other alone after that. Future interactions while among mutual friends are kept to social niceties and nothing more.

<p>
  Peter and his girlfriend get into an argument over a difference in opinion but refuse to concede their positions. The discontent festers throughout the day and leads to Peter snapping at her, furthering the rift between them. They bicker back and forth over the next few days, eventually progressing to name-calling and mocking, and finally the mutual feeling that maybe they weren't so right for each other after all. They break up soon after.

<p>
  All it takes is one experience—good or bad—to enter the spiral. The entrance's height and the momentum in which one enters depends on the intensity of the experience: trivial matters put the entrance at the beginning of the spiral and are easy to escape from, while more serious situations put the entrance deeper and are much more difficult to escape from.
