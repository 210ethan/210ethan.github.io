<!--

- choosing where to live means no racism, people arent keeping you in, you have the money to choose, arent tied down to a job/location
- having a house means less freedom. you are on the hook for mortgage/taxes until you sell it
- anecdotes: EvFr, TiWa, DaFr, LaAl,

<p>
  I bought a house in late 2021 because I foresaw myself staying in my city long-term, I predicted interest rates increasing, and it was the next logical step on my path to becoming a full-blown adult. I had readily bought into and believed in the stereotypical path of "successful" adults: go to college, get a 40-hour-a-week job, get married, buy a house, etc. I have always been in a rush to grow up, never taking time to appreciate my current situation and instead looking ahead to the next step; in high school I studied to get into a good college, in college I studied to get a good job, in my job I worked hard o get a better job. 
</p>

<p>
  The only homes I could afford as a single male with a minor inheritance and semi-meager salary were in a not-super-great area of town, one where not-super-great-people lived and life in general wasn't super great. Yet I still went forward with it because this was The Path, The Recipe, The Solution to success, unsure and nervous of my decision but guided by a malignant invisible hand, one that had been built on a foundation of growing up in middle class America. I thought the burden of the mortgage and property taxes and home repairs were for my best interest. Adam Smith had died and had been replaced by Mr. Smith, a run-of-the-mill parent who has 2.4 kids, mows the yard every weekend, and will work the same job until he retires at the ripe age of 70.
</p>

<p>
  I broke free of the latter Smith's hand in 2024 after having grown disillusioned with home ownership and living in suburbia. Wasn't owning a home supposed to be fun and rewarding? Why did I loathe it so much? Was it the clay-rich soil that constantly causing my foundation to move and house to expand and contract, making me think I had foundation issues when the doors wouldn't close and cracks formed near the crown molding? Was it the unstable floor of the loft? Was it the strange bump in the living room floor that had no apparent cause? Was it the poor job the flippers did in "renovating" the home? Or was it having to pay the lawn guy $50 every couple of weeks in the summer so I could keep my front yard clean and not draw the silent ire of my neighbors? Or was it my AC drain being so poorly designed it would clog a couple of times in the summer, forcing me to take an hour to clean out the algae and other water? Or was it freaking out when temperatures dropped to sub-freezing because my copper pipes may burst and I'd have to pay an egregious sums of cash to get it fixed? Or was it having large trees that were susceptible to the occasional violent storms leering over my roof, threatening to come crashing in if winds got over a certain speed or lightning hit just the right spot? Or was it constantly worrying that I had forgotten to close my garage door or lock the front door, despite doing my little dance and jingle that I was supposed to do every time I left to remind future me that I had indeed closed the garage or locked the door.
</p>

<p>
  And now I've opted for apartment life. I'm in a nicer part of the city that's closer to my partner and the same distance from work, has people my age that I can actually be friends with,

<p>
  The traditional American Dream is "that every person has the freedom and opportunity to succeed and attain a better life", with the cornerstones of democracy, equality, rights, and freedom supporting the decisions on the path to a better life.
