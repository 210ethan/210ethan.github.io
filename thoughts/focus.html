- ocusing on things that don't matter bc you lack more important things to do. Only do it if necessary or helpful AND nothing else more important to work on
- Ex:
  - latex vs word, just do word bc it's faster and you can get on w your life
  - reflector plate reflectometer
  - I was guilty when working on furnaces

- diminishing returns
- if you're bad at something important, work to get good at that thing!!
- important to do what makes you feel good
- people focus on things they're good at, even if it means not improving the end results
- the next step is clear whether you like it or not

  Andrei spends hours typesetting his homework and research papers because he likes the way the final product looks and believes the clean, high-quality design reflects well on him as a student and researcher. But every hour spent in his <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> environment is an hour taken away from working on research that would legitimately improve his prestige and rank. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P5k3PGzebd5yYrYqd/the-hamming-question">Hamming would be disappointed</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Andrei should <a href="https://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/">half-ass</a> his homework and papers with everything he's got and move onto actual research.
</p>

<p>
  Pierre is an entry-level engineer who makes up for lack of experience with vigor. In an effort to meaningfully contribute to his group, he takes the low hanging fruit to do <i>something</i> while the big boys crank through the scarier projects. The time these take is substantially more than the value they provide.
</p>

<p>
  Pierre should dive deep to figure out either how to contribute to the impactful projects or conceive of an impactful project of his own.

  Natasha is a stay-at-home mother who runs the household from a child-food-shelter perspective. While she always has a meal ready to go when her husband gets home, her cooking is subpar and everyone knows it. She makes up for this by ensuring the house is extra clean (it's already pretty clean), the kids are extra taken care of (they already have few, if any, complaints), and she is extra kind and caring to all (she already is a very kind woman).
</p>

<p>
  Natasha should work on improving her cooking skills to increase her family's dinnertime pleasure.

<p>
  Nikolai is an athlete competing in general fitness events that involve a lot of running, something he isn't good at due to lack of interest and his muscular build. He continues to prioritize strength and capacity work over running—two things he is already above average at—yet wonders why he places so poorly.
</p>

<p>
  Nikolai should put his strength and capacity training on maintenance mode and focus on improving his running.
