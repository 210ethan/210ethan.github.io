  How does progression relate to destruction (or creation or modification)? Is progression a (non-)zero-sum game?
</p>

<p>
  Focusing on American culture, progress is often correctly used synonymously with the word "better": computer chips being smaller and faster is progress; vehicles with higher fuel-efficiency is progress; cutting down hundreds of trees and displacing hundreds of animals to create a concrete path for people to get out into nature is progre... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pQ3L9t25GI">hol up</a>. What?!
</p>

<p>
  This is exactly what happened in Part 1. While it was never officially stated, the masterminds behind the grand vision of having a trail that looped the city undoubtedly viewed it as progress, for it was adding to the city's allure and improving the lives of all those who used it (but worsening the lives of those who had already been using what was previously there). How is this progress? How does destroying nature to get people into nature make any sense?
</p>

<p>
  It is obvious that progress is a non-zero-sum game in both directions. In the negative direction, the demolishing of the path may have encouraged a handful of people to get out and exercise, but it can be argued that the majority of users would have found a way to exercise anyway. In the positive direction, the creating of mountain bike features using dead or scrap wood is progressing the trails at the expense of nothing. No one is missing the wood, the only ones who are negatively affected are those who participate (unsuccessfully) of their own accord. So why couldn't this be the same? Two answers immediately come to mind.
</p>

<p>
  First, appealing to the lowest common denominator is the main focus of the board who makes these decisions. There is no if-you-can't-do-it-not-my-fault option (it = navigate the non-paved trails). But who says there can't be? Voters elect these board members into office in hopes that they will pursue their interests. Should the people who have a direct stake in the outcome—those who use the woods regularly and have homes nearby—have their votes count for more? The answer is a resounding yes. Akin to a representative living outside of their responsible district, it is wrong for those who will never use this path to have a significant say in its fruition. Sure, it's their city and park, too, but it's also easy to dictate how others should feel and behave when not directly affected.
