<h1 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h1>

<p>
  The three legitimate jobs I've held have all been a mix of good and not-so-good mentors. In one, my boss (mentor 1) was superb, but my trainer (mentor 2) was not. From these experiences, I've found that having a good mentor makes a dramatic impact on the position's productivity, enjoyableness, and understanding.
</p>

<p>
  Below I lay out—from my experience as both mentor and mentee—the qualities of a good mentor and their importance.

<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>

<p>
  Mentor should make sure mentee is comfortable telling them <i>anything</i> (job-related!). Mentor should never laugh at, scoff at, belittle, get angry at, etc. mentee for asking/telling them something.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Questions: Dumb or not, obvious or not, major or minor. (Questions that have been previously asked and answered are subject to a scolding.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Screw-ups: Mentee understanding that screw-ups do happen and that they aren't the end of the world is a good thing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other: Suggestions, comment, concerns, anything of the sort. Mentee should experience no hesitation in telling mentor.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>
  Making time for mentee on both a regular basis and whenever they need mentor (see above). This can include scheduling daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/biannual/annual <a href="oneone.html">one-on-ones</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Mentor should also make no indication they are annoyed by the time mentee is taking up. Replying along the lines of "I'm a bit busy right now, but can help out at XX:XXpm" is appropriate; groaning and asking "what is it <i>now</i>?!" is inappropriate.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interest">Interest</h2>

<p>
  Mentor should take an active interest in mentee's progress in the role. This does <i>not</i> mean they should micro-manage and babysit, but rather periodically check in to verify both parties' satisfaction of mentee's progress. Mentor should a) want mentee to succeed, and b) make that abundantly clear.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>
  Note that comfort, time, and interest all relate to one another: mentee is comfortable in asking for mentor's time and giving honest feedback about progress. Additionally, superb mentoring is a help-you-help-me situation. Mentee is likely to contribute more to the group, and in turn, mentor's work.
