  I'm X years old and I learn that Dad will be leaving my brother and I in the care of our grandmother—his mother—for not eternity, but a couple of days to watch his half-brother play in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. My life flashes before my eyes as I think how horrible those days would be. I had some form of anxiety at the time that was especially triggered by new authority figures having control (bus drivers, substitute teachers, grandmothers in the place of parents). I can't handle that, no way, not in a million years. I cry, I beg, I plead with him not to go, not to leave me and my brother. He relents, pacifying my mistaken anxiety and missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

  I'm X (seven?) years old and have just arrived at the Cub Scout chess tournament. Dad and I have been playing and practicing daily for months (mainly me trying to sneak an obvious four-move checkmate on him). It's a welcome routine after he gets home from work and I've had enough of watching TV or playing with something. I lose my queen in the first game, yet persist and beat him. (I later find out he made an illegal move with his knight to take my queen.) I breeze through the next few games to become the coveted Cub Scout Chess Champion. Dad is beaming at the fruitful, satisfying outcome of our hard work.

  I'm 12 years old and at my first ever mountain bike race. I am absolutely psyched to shred the "banana bike" (the nickname of our old—you guessed it—yellow Cannondale F700) and whoop some ass while doing so. But the competition looks fierce, and I <i>hate</i> the idea of not doing as well as I expected, which was first. It begins to rain and the only lodging option we have is the tent and sleeping bags we brought. My anxiety builds and I convince Dad to leave. He gently protests, but eventually softens after realizing how much I want to go home. I never race after that.

  I'm 12 years old and sitting in middle school social studies daydreaming about girls and mountain bike builds in the forest behind my home. An office assistant comes in and hands the teacher a pink slip, indicating someone was lucky enough to miss out on the topic at hand to go elsewhere. Much to my surprise, that someone was me. I had a lingering feeling about what it was...but kept it stifled so as not to have all the excitement come crashing down. It was unnecessary. My dad was waiting in the lobby, and outside was the family truck with our mountain bikes in the bed. "Ready to ride Flat Rock?" he asked with a grin on his face.

  I'm 14 years old and have been training for my middle school's mile run record for the past five months, getting up at 5:00am to train and sacrificing my would-be social life and fun in pursuit of the goal. And it's finally paid off: the record was smashed by over two seconds. My dad writes in to the city's major newspaper about my training—they reject it, I find out and am angry at the spotlight being turned on me, until I take a second to realize that it takes an immense amount of pride to send something like that to the newspaper.

  I'm 19 years old and am at home in the summer when Dad suspiciously calls and asks if I'll be home in just a bit. I answer "yes..." and he quickly mumbles an affirmative and hangs up. Minutes later the doorbell rings, causing me to slyly creep up the stairs to see who it is. Is that Mr. A?! My dad's coworkers, who have a pretty cool job, are swarming the front of the house, meandering around and chatting with each other. I get dressed and head outside to see the ruckus. "We were in the neighborhood and I figured a picture would be pretty cool." Fuck yeah, it would be. I say my goodbyes and immediately head inside to order wallet-sized prints.
