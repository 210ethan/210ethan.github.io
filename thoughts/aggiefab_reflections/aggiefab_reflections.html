<p>
  First, a brief history and description of my role at AggieFab.
</p>

<p>
  AggieFab is a shared-user nanofabrication facility open to anyone who pays the membership and equipment fees. Texas A&M students, other university students, and private companies are welcome to join and use the facilities. The lab has tools that allow users to create devices on the micro- (one-millionth of one meter, or 10<sup>-6</sup> m) and nano-scale (one billionth of one meter, or 10<sup>-9</sup> m). Users vary heavily on discipline—while AggieFab is under the electrical engineering department's umbrella, students from materials science, chemistry, petroleum engineering, and even pharmaceuticals sciences use the facilities. The projects are equally as diverse: from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics">microfluidics</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_nitride#Applications">GaN-based technologies</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide">waveguides</a>, there is a bit of everything (as long as it is quite small and needs to be physically fabricated).
</p>

<p>
  I began working there as a student technician in October 2017 and ended in May 2020 — 2.5 years total, excluding the summer of 2019, when I was interning at a company. I worked 20 hours per week every week, except for shorter weeks or holidays (where I worked anywhere between 20-39 hours).
</p>

<p>
  I had four primary responsibilities:
</p>

<h3 id="training_advising">Training and Advising of New Users</h3>

<p>
  Whenever new or existing users needed training or assistance on tools, I helped them to learn the tool's operation and theory and answered any questions they had that was unique to their project. This requires an understanding of the entire process. For example, if a user was having trouble performing lithography, I would ask a few questions about their process, make any obvious improvements, then go and observe them in the lab.
</p>

<h3 id="tool_maintenance_repair_install">Tool Maintenance, Repair, and Installation</h3>

<p>
  All of the tools used are very technical. A majority have <a href="../../research/vacuum/vacuum.html">vacuum systems</a> and almost all have electronics. Because of the constant usage—some of which is very stressful on the tool—preventative maintenance and repairs were done on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
  Occasionally <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2019/06/03/11m-gift-from-hewlett-packard-enterprise-creates-new-computing-engineering-center-at-texas-am-system/">new tools were acquired</a> (hey, that's me!) by donation or purchase. I assisted in installation alongside other student workers, full-time staff, and factory engineers/technicians.
</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>
  Documentation in the form of tool manuals, troubleshooting guides, and process guides were used to advance understanding for tool users and standardize maintenance and repair procedures.
</p>

<h3 id="misc_tasks">Miscellaneous Tasks</h3>

<p>
  Checking inventory and restocking, help moving large items, taking funny pictures, etc. It was a new experience every day.

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

<p>
  Up to my start date in October 2017, I had no meaningful interactions with any international students. I grew up in a predominantly white and Hispanic area and never sought out others of different ethnicities.
</p>

<p>
  Hollywood provides the naïve individual a stereotype of how an Asian or European acts: their tendencies, mannerisms, dress, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  Time and time again it is said that anybody who leaves America and experiences another culture for the first time is dramatically surprised and possibly even changed by that exposure. Outside of leaving America or traveling to an enclave of minorities, the closest you can get to this experience is speaking to international students and learning about their culture.

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>
  I've come to learn that I am <i>obsessed</i> with progress and learning. Obsession is not an exaggeration nor for-lack-of-a-better-term. Progress was embodied in a few different ways.
