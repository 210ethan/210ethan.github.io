<h1>AggieFab Reflections</h1>

<p>
  First, a brief history and description of my role at AggieFab.
</p>

<p>
  AggieFab is a shared-user nanofabrication facility open to anyone who pays the membership and equipment fees. Texas A&M students, other university's students, and private companies are welcome to join and use the facilities. The lab has tools that allow users to create devices on the micro- (one-millionth of one meter, or 10<sup>-6</sup> m) and nano-scale (one billionth of one meter, or 10<sup>-9</sup> m). Users vary heavily on discipline—while AggieFab is under the electrical engineering department's umbrella, students from materials science, chemistry, petroleum engineering, and even pharmaceuticals sciences. The projects are equally as diverse: from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics">microfluidics</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_nitride#Applications">GaN-based technologies</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide">waveguides</a>, there is a bit of everything (as long as it needs to be physically fabricated).
</p>

<p>
  I began working there as a student technician in October 2017 and ended in May 2020 — 2.5 years total, excluding the summer of 2019, when I was interning for Texas Instruments. I worked 20 hours per week every week, except for shorter weeks or holidays (where I worked anywhere between 20-39 hours).
</p>

<p>
  I had three primary responsibilities:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Training and advising of new users</b>. Whenever new or existing users needed training on tools, I helped them to learn the tool's operation and theory and answered any questions they had that was unique to their project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tool maintenance, repair, and installation</b>. [FINISH]
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Miscellaneous tasks</b>. [FINISH]
  </li>
</ol>

  Up to my start date in October 2017, I had no meaningful interactions with any international students.
