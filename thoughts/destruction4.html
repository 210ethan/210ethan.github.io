  There exists one last bastion of hope, one last place that appears to be safe from the reaches of "progress" and destruction, one last place in which memories of mine don't exist and new ones can be formed.

  Sometime destruction misses things. Whether they actually missed it, didn't care about it, or were too lazy to finish the job varies by situation. Akin to <a href="momentum.html">discipline momentum</a>, the longer it goes on still standing after everything else around it has been demolished, the less likely it is to meet the same fate. The important part in all of it is that it's still there, safe from the hands that brought its peers to their doom.

<p>
  It's in circumstances like this that two things should be done. First, appreciate the fact that it remains intact, regardless of the reason. Luck or not, generosity or not, it still stands. Go enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
  Second, take advantage of it still being there. This may mean leaving it untouched

you can also build things from what has been destroyed
