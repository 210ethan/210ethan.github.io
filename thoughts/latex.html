<p>
  For readers that don't know what <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> is, a brief primer.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="tex">T<sub>e</sub>X</span>, pronounced "tech", is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">typesetting system</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> in the 1970s. LaTeX, pronounced "lay-tech", is a macro package that allows for documents to be written more easily in TeX.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.tug.org/levels.html">levels of TeX</a> are as follows (paraphrased from the original):
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Distributions:</b> Large, coherent collections of TeX-related software to be downloaded and installed. When someone says &ldquo;I need to install TeX on my machine&rdquo;, they're usually looking for a distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Front ends and editors:</b> Used to create a document file. Some (e.g., TeXShop) are devoted specifically to TeX, others (e.g., Emacs) can be used to edit any sort of file. TeX documents are independent of any particular editor; the TeX typesetting program itself does not include an editor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Engines:</b> Executable binaries which implement different TeX variants.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Formats:</b> TeX-based languages in which one actually writes documents.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Packages:</b> These are add-ons to the basic TeX system, developed independently, providing additional typesetting features, fonts, documentation, etc.  A package might or might not work with any given format and/or engine; for example, many are designed specifically for LaTeX, but there are plenty of others, too. The <a href="https://ctan.org/">CTAN sites</a> provide access to the vast majority of packages in the TeX world; CTAN is generally the source used by the distributions.
    </li>
  </ol>
