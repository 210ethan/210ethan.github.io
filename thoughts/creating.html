<h1 id="creating">Creating and Developing</h1>

<p>
  A core tenet of my life philosophy is that creating and developing often, but not always, leads to a fulfilling and satisfying life. Creation is the forming something from nothing. Developing is the progression, although not necessarily improvement, of creations. Both have their places in life.
</p>

<h2 id="creativity">Creativity</h2>

<p>
  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>, the pyramid's tip consists of nouns that are primarily subjective to the person, while varying wildly across persons as a whole—this is referred to as self-actualization, or achieving one's full potential. Morality differs between people, where person A thinks X is an egregious offense and B deems to okay; creativity comes in different forms, such as art or writing; spontaneity is present or not-so-present in people; problem solving can be applied across a spectrum of different problems; creating mountain bike features is arguably the only absolute... ("Acceptance of facts" is covered up by my entry.)

<p>
  Both creation and development often encompass many of the self-actualization components. Some believe it's moral to dispense as much free knowledge as possible. Person A creates a project as open-source for the world to see and develop and model other projects off of. Creativity is required in larger amounts for some projects more than others. Problem solving is needed for all aspects. How to create in general, and then for optimality or efficiency? Where should this project lead, and how to develop it along the way to get it there? Accepting when something can't be built nor created grounds the individual to reality and prevents futile attempts at impossible tasks.
</p>

<p>
  Is creation or development more important? There is equal merit in both, and is greatly dependent on the application. Some (myself) prefer creating certain things (mountain bike features) and leaving them to be—no maintenance, no improvement. It's left there to rot to oblivion or until someone hurts themselves and I feel bad and go fix it. In other areas of my life, development is preferred. I enjoy developing my training capabilities (strength, aerobic capacity) rather than delving into other disciplines and becoming too much of a jack of all trades and master of none. But there are also areas where creation and development are paired, neither being more important than the other. The principle example is this website. All pages are updated as they need to be (development), whether my thoughts change on the subject or more information comes to light, while new pages are regularly added (creation). I have no preference and each is performed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.
</p>

<p>
  Yet there are (likely) individuals who exclusively create or exclusively develop. Their abilities may be profound in one area but not the other (although this is unlikely). A more likely explanation is they just plain prefer one over the other. [FINISH]

<p>
  As previously mentioned, creating and developing allow for freedom of expression, a freedom few take full advantage of. Practically anything can be created, so long as it can be imagined and the resources are available. Anything can be developed, whether branching from the original path that project was on to a more personal one or continuing to drive towards the vision the creator or other developers have for it. The point is the choice is up to the individual. There is no right or wrong, good or bad. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and those who choose to use the project. Freedom is a luxury nowadays. Jobs and managers and markets dictate day-to-day, month-to-month, even year-to-year responsibilities and priorities, leaving little room over long periods to choose enticing projects. Leading a family has some leeway, but ultimately comes down to taking care of business. Up to 20 hours of the day is spent on non-creative tasks, leaving a measly four hours to pursue personal projects and satisfy the remaining items on the tip of Maslow's pyramid.
</p>

<p>
  But is four hours enough to placate the creative itch many have burning up inside them?
