<p>
  Back in February 2020, I somehow stumbled upon to <a href="https://guzey.com/">Alexey Guzey</a>'s Twitter, where the first post I saw was his support of <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/">Ben Kuhn</a>'s <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/11/">1:1 blog post</a>:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">am convinced pretty much everyone would improve their long term odds of success massively if they just asked their SO or a close friend to take the responsibility for conducting weekly 1:1s with them <a href="https://t.co/qKNpiNFyt9">https://t.co/qKNpiNFyt9</a></p>&mdash; Scott Alexander (@alexeyguzey) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1229968143067598848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
  This concept was something I had been considering for some time, but never got around to actually setting up. No one in my friend group or family—immediate or extended—has similar interests to me, nor would any of them be interested in doing something like this. Regardless, I still wanted someone I could get honest, valuable feedback from and to provide it myself. Where to?
</p>

<p>
  The community I find myself most in-line with is that of Slate Star Codex, specifically its <a href="https://reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex">subreddit</a>. So, I posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/fhnh59/oneonone_partner_thread/">partner-finding thread</a>, encouraging anyone interested in starting 1:1's to post their info (age, gender, brief personal description, time commitment, expectations from the sessions) to advertise for potential partners. There were a few responses, and I got a private message a few hours later from one of the posters. We both agreed that we were compatible with each other, so a voice call was set up for the following week. The rest is history... (read: we became partners and still do 1:1's on a weekly basis).
</p>

<h2 id="ideal_partner">Ideal Partner</h2>

<p>
  The ideal partner should have a few traits (in order of importance):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Empathy</b>: When discussing issues, they don't dismiss them, but rather try and help you work through them. You should feel comfortable telling them personal things (obviously depth is up to you) without fear of being belittled or judged.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Honesty</b>: One of the main purposes of 1:1's is getting feedback on ideas, work, and other things in your life. It's incredibly important that this feedback is honest.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Intelligence</b>:
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Life Experience</b>:
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Outside of these traits,
</p>



<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>
  The format we use is quite simple.
</p>

<p>
  First, we review the past week of each our lives. Any notable events, the status of our to-do items from the previous meeting, and anything else on our minds, important or trivial. Questions are asked by both of us.
</p>









<p>
  Finally, we end with a plan for next week.
</p>
