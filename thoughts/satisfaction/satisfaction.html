<h1 id="satisfaction">Deprivation for Satisfaction</h1>

<p>
  The old saying goes:
</p>

<blockquote>
  You don't know what you got till it's gone.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I propose the following variant:
</p>

<blockquote>
  You don't know what you don't got till you really, really, <i>really</i> want it.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In plain English, objects and actions we a) want and/or need, and b) take for granted, are not fully appreciated. We can drink clean, cold water at any moment we please; we have food available at our fingertips via delivery services; we can sleep when we want; most of us have weekends off from work and enjoy that time pursuing personal hobbies. But when was the last time you <i>really</i> wanted one of these, yet couldn't have it? My hypothesis is simple: the longer we wait for things we want/need, the more satisfaction they bring us. I expect a logarithmic return, i.e., satisfaction does not continue to increase after a certain amount of time waiting.
</p>

<p>
  My life doesn't have too many satisfying moments to it. I get excited at having a solid exercise session or reading a good book or spending time with friends. I take what I can get with minimal additional effort, which is exactly what this post discusses: increasing both the quantity and intensity of satisfying moments without too much additional effort. (The effort comes from abstaining, not performing.)
</p>

<p>
  The model I visualize this with is simple:
</p>

<img src="media/plot.png" alt="plot" style="width:1000px;height:300px" class="center">

<p>
  Note the area under both curves. The negative one (curve from 0 to 30) is approximately -15, while the positive one (curve from 30 to 35) is approximately 40, giving a net positive satisfaction of +35. In plain English, the satisfaction I get from indulging in something after abstaining from it is much greater than the dissatisfaction I get from solely abstaining from it.
</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  Here I run X [FINISH] different types of experiments. The procedures are not rigorous nor do I care that they aren't. Hypothesis quantification values range from the following: "(slightly, moderately, extremely) more satisfying".
</p>

<h3 id="food">Food</h3>

<p>
  I will establish the baseline satisfaction I get from food on an average day. Once this is determined, I will fast for 24 hours, then prepare and eat an identical meal and compare the satisfaction I experience. This will be done on three separate, spread-out occasions. I expect the food to be significantly more satisfying.

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>
  My body tends to become sleepy when either a) I lie down (especially while reading), or b) it gets around my bedtime (9:00pm) and I woke up that morning around 4:00am. It's a double-whammy when I lie down in my bed to read before sleeping. When I begin to doze off while reading is when I put the book down and go to sleep. Funnily enough, as soon as I yawn while reading is when this normally happensâ€”sleepiness jumps from a small intensity to a moderate intensity almost immediately. Sleepiness intensity increases rapidly after this point. I fall asleep in 5-15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  For one week, I will go to bed at my normal bedtime and note down the following: what time I woke up, what I did for exercise that day (type and intensity), how stressful and exhausting the day was, how tired I feel at bedtime, and how satisfying it was to go to bed on a scale of 1-10.
</p>

<p>
  For the following week, I will go to bed at my normal bedtime of 9:00pm, but will continue reading 0:15 hr past when "I begin to doze off". The purpose here is to become very sleepy, which is accomplished just as well if I stayed up many hours past my normal bedtime. I also don't want to sacrifice the amount of sleep I get, which is already less than desired.
</p>

<p>
  I expect the ability to finally go to sleep will be moderately more satisfying.

<h3 id="work_free_time">Work/Free Time</h3>

<p>
  My average weekday (M-F) goes something like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wake up: 4:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal time: 4:00-7:00am (0:30 prep/commute, 1:30 exercise, 0:30 commute/prep, 0:30 daily tasks)
  </li>
  <li>
    Work: 7:00am-4:00pm (including 0:30-1:00 breaks)
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal time: 4:00-9:00pm (0:15 commute, 1:00 chores, 3:30 free time)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bedtime: 9:00-9:30pm (0:30 reading)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I consider prep/commute, exercise, daily tasks, and chores necessary items, thus not free time. This gives a maximum of 4:00 hr of free time per day, split between after-work and bedtime reading.
</p>

<p>
  For one week, I will change my weekday working time to 7:00am-7:00pm with proportional breaks (1:00 hr break per 9:00 hr work = 1:20 hr break per 12:00 hr work). I hope the effect will be two-fold: I will more greatly appreciate only working 8:00 hr/day and I will more greatly appreciate having 4:00 hr free time. These are almost identical (working less = being at home more), but I separate the two in my mind.
