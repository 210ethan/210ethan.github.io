  - solutions:
    - give up and accept that beauty is a thing, so start working to make yourself more attractive
    - make an honest attempt to treat people by merit and not looks
    - if attractive, start dressing worse to help the look-poor

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism">Lookism</a>, the "prejudice or discrimination toward people who are considered to be physically unattractive", is rarely talked about as a social cause because of the benefits it provides to those who aren't afflicted by it. Activists who claim to be for equality should be doing more to level the playing field for less attractive people, especially because attractiveness is well within one's own control through a variety of methods, such as dress, speech, makeup, etc.
</p>

[UPDATE THIS BASED ON MY FINDINGS]

<p>
  I examine why lookism isn't more widely addressed, try to summarize the negative effects of being unattractive, and compare those to other social causes to help establish an order of what should be worked on first.
</p>

<h2 id="causes">Causes on an Activist's Radar</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism">Lookism</a>, the "prejudice or discrimination toward people who are considered to be physically unattractive" (which can also be formed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_privilege">pretty privilege</a>), is rarely listed as a social justice cause. Surely it qualifies to be included given the common themes of diversity, inclusion, equality, and fairness? Life is definitely better for the attractive than the unattractive, <i>ceteris paribus</i>. Judging someone based on their race, age, height, gender, disability, or intelligence is frowned upon, so why isn't looks? Or if it is frowned upon, why isn't anyone doing anything about it by trying to prettify the ugly or uglify the pretty?
</p>

<h2 id="elephant">The (Unattractive) Elephants in the Room</h2>

<p>
  Lookism and pretty privilege is arguably well-known and understood to be true, just not talked about for a few potential reasons.
</p>

<h3 id="moloch">Moloch</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a> returns, but this time he's hot. Liv Boeree summarizes the relationship between Moloch and lookism well in her <i>Moloch & Beauty Wars</i>:
</p>

<p>
  If Attractive Alice chooses to forgo makeup and nice clothes on her path towards improving the universal treatment of Ugly Olgas, she will also forgo a number of benefits the makeup provides: better pay (<a href="">1</a>, <a href="">2</a>, <a href="">3</a>), <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/22/i-get-festival-tickets-and-drinks-for-free-because-im-pretty/">free stuff</a> (anecdotes galore here), better treatment from both men and women, etc.
</p>

<p>
  But her competit...friends, the ones who keep wearing makeup and dressing well, will continue reaping the benefits of better raises, free dinners and drinks, nicer interactions. Why should Alice suffer while these other women prosper? That's not fair! And thus the endless cycle of competition begins.
</p>

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition of Varying Degrees of Beauty</h3>

<p>
  It's naive and ignorant, but comfortable, to claim everyone's equally beautiful, at least in their own way. Beauty is subjective culture-by-culture, meaning it's effectively objective culture-by-culture, e.g., an attractive American may not be attractive in a countries practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblouh">leblouh</a>, but she's likely to be attractive across all of America (the converse is also true).
</p>

<p>
  By acknowledging lookism, one acknowledges there exists beautiful and not-beautiful, whether they believe it or not.

<h2 id="quantification">Quantifying the Impact of Ugliness</h2>

<p>
  We must understand just how much looks help or hurt others in order to rank it accordingly in the causes; if it helps a lot, then more emphasis should be put on looking less attractive by those who are more attractive.
</p>

<p>
  The 1994 paper <a href="media/lookism/Beauty%20and%20the%20Labor%20Market.pdf">Beauty and the Labor Market</a> was the first to quantify attractiveness vs. compensation:
</p>

<blockquote>
  A recent example is Irene Frieze et al. (1991) [<a href="media/lookism/Attractiveness%20and%0Income%20for%20Men%20and%20Women%20in%20Management.pdf">Attractiveness and Income for Men and Women in Management</a>], who studied earnings of MBA's over the first ten post-degree years. Ratings of beauty based on photographs of the students while in school were correlated positively with both starting and subsequent salaries for males. Among females there was no correlation with starting salary, but more attractive women experienced more rapid salary growth [ENTER VALUES FROM STUDY HERE]
