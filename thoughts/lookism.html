  And yet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism">lookism</a>, the "prejudice or discrimination toward people who are considered to be physically unattractive" (which can also be formed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_privilege">pretty privilege</a>), is not mentioned. Surely it qualifies to be included given the common themes of diversity, inclusion, equality, and fairness? Life is definitely better for the attractive than the unattractive, <i>ceteris paribus</i>. Judging someone based on their race, age, height, gender, disability, or intelligence is frowned upon, so why isn't looks? Or if it is frowned upon, why isn't anyone doing anything about it?

  Lookism and pretty privilege is arguably well-known, just not talked about for a few potential reasons.

  <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a> returns, but this time he's hot af. Liv Boeree summarizes the relationship between Moloch and lookism well in her <i>Moloch & Beauty Wars</i>:

  If Attractive Alice chooses to forgo makeup and nice clothes on her path towards improving the universal treatment of Ugly Olgas, she will also forgo a number of benefits the makeup provides: better pay (<a href="https://wol.iza.org/articles/does-it-pay-to-be-beautiful/long">1</a>, <a href="">2</a>, <a href="">3</a>), <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/22/i-get-festival-tickets-and-drinks-for-free-because-im-pretty/">free stuff</a> (anecdotes galore here), better treatment from both men and women, the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
  But her compet...friends, the ones who keep wearing makeup and dressing well, will continue reaping the benefits of better raises, free dinners and drinks, etc. Why should Alice suffer while these women prosper? That's not fair! And thus the endless cycle of competition begins.

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition of Varying Degrees of Beauty</h3>

<p>
  It's naive, ignorant, but comfortable to claim everyone's equally beautiful, at least in their own way. Beauty is subjective culture-by-culture, meaning it's effectively objective culture-by-culture: an attractive American may not be attractive in a countries practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblouh">leblouh</a>, but she's likely to be attractive across all of America.
