<p>
  Becoming famous (and preferably rich) allows for unaccessible funds to be used on causes deemed worthy.

  Years ago—I can't remember when or where, so if the reader knows, please <a href="../about/about.html#contact">contact me</a>—I read something that went like:
</p>

<blockquote>
  One of the best things you can do for humanity is to become rich and famous and use your influence to fund worthy causes.
</blockquote>

<p>
  (This makes the assumption that the person becoming rich and famous is reasonable and altruistic, both of which are not givens, but something that will still be assumed for this post for simplicity's sake.)
</p>

<p>
  I wholeheartedly agree with this idea, and believe it to be especially pronounced and relevant in today's world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial relationships</a> between celebrities and their fans.

  Going into a major Twitch streamer's chat can show how high of a pedestal some viewers put the streamer on. Constant messages saying the equivalent of "notice me senpai" flood the chat, with donations popping up on screen with the same message. The same thing can be seen with mentions of celebrities on Twitter (@[celebrity Twitter handle]):
</p>

<blockquote>
  happy birthday brother, you’re a literal walking W, i’ve been a fan since way way way before, back when you were a real CHOC. still loved you then man but so fucking proud of the progress you’ve made as a human...let’s hope jake somehow can followSmiling face with tear @LoganPaul love you brother

  and replies to their tweets, despite <a href="https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1400890093766807554">the tweet</a> being nothing significant:

  These people may just be all talk and no walk, as tweeting at someone is essentially free. A better metric would be to look at how much money is spent on the celebrity, especially money in which nothing tangible is received in return (AKA donations). Yet again, the easiest way to observe this is by watching a Twitch stream and its chat. All donations show up there and sometimes even pop up on screen.
