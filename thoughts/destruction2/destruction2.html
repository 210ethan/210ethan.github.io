  How does progression relate to destruction (or creation or modification)? Is progression a (non-)zero-sum game?
</p>

<p>
  Focusing on American culture, progress is often correctly used synonymously with the word "better": computer chips being smaller and faster is progress; vehicles with higher fuel-efficiency is progress; cutting down hundreds of trees and displacing hundreds more animals to create a concrete nature path for people is progre... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pQ3L9t25GI">hol up</a>. What?!
</p>

<p>
  But this is exactly what happened in Part 1. While it was never officially stated, the masterminds behind the grand vision of having a trail that looped the city undoubtedly viewed it as progress, for it was adding to the city's allure and improving the lives of all those who used it (and worsening those who had already been using what was previously there). How is this progress? How does destroying nature to get people into nature make any sense?
</p>

<p>
  It is obvious that progress is a non-zero-sum game. The creating of mountain bike features using dead wood is progressing the trails at the expense of nothing. No one is missing the wood, the only ones who are negatively affected are those who participate of their own accord. So why couldn't this be the same? Two answers immediately come to mind.
</p>

<p>
  First, appealing to the lowest common denominator is the main focus of the board who makes these decisions. There is no if-you-can't-do-it-not-my-fault option. But who says there can't be? Voters elect these board members into office in hopes that they will pursue their interests.
