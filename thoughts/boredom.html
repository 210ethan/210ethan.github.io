- Boring tends to work because of consistency
- Excitement means switching it up, lack of consistency means it doesnâ€™t work
- "Boredom implies monotony, which implies consistency, which produces results"
- focusing on the process, not the goal ("enjoy the process")
- deliberate practice is what makes you better, not half-assed practice on a variety of things
- get rich quick
- patience
- mark twight: it doesnt have to be fun to be fun

<h1 id="boredom">Boredom</h1>

<p>
  Boredom in life and training can often tell us more than we think.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Boredom and how to eliminate it is a popular question and topic within many fields. Some examples readily come to mind.
</p>

<p>
  I
</p>

<p>
  New fitness practitioners&mdash;depending on the practice&mdash;wonder why exercise is <i>soooooo boring</i> and when it will get fun. They are <i>soooooo bored</i> of doing the same boring movements over and over and decide to switch up. They have a blast at the expense of the progress they made and wonder why they're still in the same place as when they started. They give up, thinking exercise doesn't work and it's just not for them.
</p>

<p>
  II
</p>

<p>
  Programmers long for the allure towards code they experienced during their honeymoon phase went as they slowly slip into a boring schedule filled with meetings and not-so-fun projects. The coding gurus promised fancy machine learning and a six-figure job at a FAANG in only a few short months, but all the programmer can see is basic web development and all they know is their cubicle and all they feel is angst at this being their role for the next 40 years before retirement. They give up thinking there's little room for progression and go back to their former job before the bootcamp.
</p>

  III
</p>

<p>
  Language learners hit a wall around the A2 level and come to the realization a language can't be learnt in 30 days&mdash;it's going to take much, much longer. They stare down the abyss of grammar, nuances of pronunciation, and seemingly infinite vocabulary, thinking about how boring it will be to learn and practice all of that. Is it really worth it all anyway? After all, English is the lingua franca of the world. They give up in the face of years of practice and continue being Americ...monolingual.
</p>

<p>
  IV
</p>

<p>
  Investors question where the excitement of making money is and why all those nerds on the Bogleheads forum advocate for index funds. They withdraw all funds and begin day trading, taking advice from other online forums that obviously know better and forming their own theories on why this company is going to blow up and that company is going to tank. They finally have something to talk about at the water cooler, even if money is being lost at an alarming rate. When the principal hits zero and all is lost, all trust in the stock market is lost. They give up, never putting another penny into the market and living paycheck-to-paycheck.
</p>

<p>
  Overweight people find counting calories and measuring food to lose weight to be inconvenient and mundane, nothing like the smiling people on the television made it seem like. After a few weeks of counting and measuring, the scale shows a slightly lower number than it had in the past few years. They begin to question the efficacy of calories in vs. calories out, and after reading some pop health articles on some pop health websites, decide to forget about CICO and only eat based on feel and how much food there seems to be on the plate. "I've been counting for a few weeks. My calorie estimates are calibrated by now." The scale quickly jumps back up to the same weight. They give up, claiming their bodies just aren't made for losing weight and they're stuck that way forever.
</p>

<p>
  These are all examples I've experienced either first-hand or second-hand, and all have a few common themes. [expectations, patience, they made progress but didn't notice it!]
</p>

<p>
  These three examples imply boredom is bad, even passively harmful (lack of exercise = health issues down the road), increasing the desirability of positions with that oh-so-sexy variety. This is one appeal of CrossFit: main site WODs don't follow specific programming, instead acting more like the sets, reps, and movements are being pulled out of a hat while the chooser isn't looking.
