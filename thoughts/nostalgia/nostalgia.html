<h1 id="nostalgia">Nostalgia</h1>

<p>
  I think about the past every day. Some of it's about <a href="../regret/regret.html">regret</a> and what I wish I had done differently or at all. Some of it's reminiscing on childhood memories I wish I could relive. Some of it's using past decisions to guide future ones. It's a variety of different thoughts, and I've started to think it's unhealthy.
