<h2 id="work">Making Work More Enjoyable</h2>

<p>
  Exploring ways to make almost any job and workplace more enjoyable without fundamentally changing the job's responsibilities.

<p>
  Work should be an mostly-enjoyable way of spending <a href="https://80000hours.org/about/">80,000 hours</a> of life. To spend that doing something mostly-<i>un</i>enjoyable is borderline torturous and definitely stupid: the worker will simply end up bitter, unhappy, and unfulfilled having just wasted the 30-40 most energetic and prime years of life.
</p>

<p>
  Notice I say "mostly-enjoyable". The naive person who came up with "find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life" has got some serious explaining to do, and the poor schmuck who believes it has got some major reality checks ahead of him. (I know the "never" part is hyperbole, but there are some people out there who don't realize that). There are very, very, <i>very</i> few jobs in which that quote rings true. I was lucky enough to bag one of these bad boys with my <a href="../aggiefab/aggiefab.html">university job</a> (AggieFab). I can count the number of times I didn't look forward to work on one hand and still have fingers left over. This came with a price: I was given extremely high expectations for what future jobs would look and feel like, when in fact the AggieFab job was the exception, not the norm.
</p>

<p>
  Almost every job out there will have boring days, spreadsheet work, and pointless, yet required, meetings. Almost every job out there will have days where you don't want to go in. To make work enjoyable, the intensity, duration, and frequency of those feelings and actions should be minimized and the intensity, duration, and frequency of good/fun/enjoyable activities maximized. This is obvious, but some of those characteristics are fixed, meaning you can't get out of that hour-long meeting in 30 minutes, sorry.
</p>

<h2 id="friends">How to Spend 10,000+ Hours with Friends While Getting Paid (Employers Hate This Method!)</h2>

<p>
  I remember my first few days at AggieFab. I had no clue what to do task-wise or even what the lab really did and didn't know my coworkers very well. I was lost. The work I was being assigned was menial—mundane tasks that soon led to me questioning my decision to work here. I noticed the satisfaction curve trended upwards the more I interacted with my coworkers and lab users. I began to learn more about them: their cultures (a majority were <a href="../aggiefab/aggiefab.html#diversity">international students</a>), their interests outside of work, their personal lives, their career aspirations. I became friends with almost everyone who worked there, and good friends with a handful.
</p>

<p>
  It was when I reached the multiple-friend level that I realized work had become a social activity and that was a major factor in why I looked forward to it so much. We told jokes, gave advice, talked about weekend escapades, alongside actual work.
</p>

<p>
  There is a reason why parties are fun and quarantining during a pandemic sucks: we enjoy spending time with friends. We enjoy talking with them about this and that, we enjoy just having silent company. This basic fact is why making and developing friendships at work is so important: by it becoming a form of social activity, the dreadful tone of voice that typically accompanies "work" is dropped and all that's left is the excitement of spending 40-50 hours a week with some of your best buds!
</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> has become more popular in the past few years, especially in health and education spaces. The strategies I refer to are such:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Early gamification strategies use rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks or competition to engage players. Types of rewards include points, achievement badges or levels, the filling of a progress bar, or providing the user with virtual currency. Making the rewards for accomplishing tasks visible to other players or providing leader boards are ways of encouraging players to compete.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I've found great success in using gamification for satisfaction in work and life. While I don't use an app or official system, I keep track of to-do progress in my head or design my work for it to show visually.
</p>

<p>
  Care should be taken to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law </a>, as doing tasks just for the sake of numbers is <i>not</i> a good idea:
</p>

<blockquote>
  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Progress can be measured in other ways.
