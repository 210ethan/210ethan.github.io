<h2 id="work">Making Work More Enjoyable</h2>

<p>
  I explore some ways to make almost any job and workplace more enjoyable without fundamentally changing the job's responsibilities.

  Work should be an mostly-enjoyable way of spending <a href="https://80000hours.org/about/">80,000 hours</a> of life. To spend that doing something mostly-<i>un</i>enjoyable is borderline torturous and definitely stupid: the worker will simply end up bitter, unhappy, and unfulfilled having just wasted the 30-40 most energetic and prime years of life.
</p>

<p>
  Notice I say "mostly-enjoyable". The naive person who came up with "find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life" has got some serious explaining to do, and the poor schmuck who believes it has got some major reality checks ahead of him. (I know the "never" part is hyperbole, but there are some people out there who don't realize that). There are very, very, <i>very</i> few jobs in which that quote rings true. I was lucky to bag one of these bad boys with my <a href="../aggiefab/aggiefab.html">university job</a>. I can count the number of times I didn't look forward to work on one hand and still have fingers left over. This came with a price: I was given extremely high expectations for what future jobs would look and feel like, when in fact the AggieFab job was the exception, not the norm.

  Almost every job out there will have boring days, spreadsheet work, and pointless, yet required, meetings. Almost every job out there will have days where you don't want to go in. To make work enjoyable, the intensity, duration, and frequency of those feelings and actions should be minimized and the intensity, duration, and frequency of good/fun/enjoyable activities maximized. This is obvious, but some of those characteristics are fixed, meaning you can't get out of that hour-long meeting in 30 minutes, sorry.
