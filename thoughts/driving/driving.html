<h2 id="driving">Making Driving Enjoyable (Or At Least Not Unenjoyable)</h2>

<p>
  If you've ever lived in Texas, you've probably heard the joke: "you can drive in any direction for 8 hours and you'll still be in Texas!" While cliche, it is true: to get between any worthwhile city (Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio), it takes a fair amount of driving. Even getting somewhere within those cities can take a while due to gross congestion. Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are the 9th, 7th, and 4th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population">largest cities in the U.S.</a>
</p>

<p>
  Driving is a necessary evil (unless you're driving a really fun car, then it's an optional luxury!) in the U.S., so why not try to make it as enjoyable as possible? (Of course, it is a luxury to us at all times—having to rely on public transport here is the true evil.)
</p>

<h2 id="time_stress">Time and Stress</h2>

<p>
  The average American's commute time is <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&table=DP03&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP03">26 minutes</a> (label "Mean travel time to work (minutes)"), giving a grand total of:
</p>

\[\text{total driving} = 52 \, \text{min/day} \times 250 \, \text{day/year} = 13000 \, \text{min/year} = 215 \, \text{hr/year}\]

<p>
  And this is just commuting time! It doesn't include time spent driving to grocery shopping, social gathering, etc., which adds a significant amount of hours to the commute total (by my personal experience and estimation, it would be 50+—1 hour per week).
</p>

<p>
  Further, driving—especially commuting—is generally a stressful activity as shown in the literature.
