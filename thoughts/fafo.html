<h1 id="fafo.html">Fucking Around and Finding Out as a Learning Philosophy</h1>

<p>
  Unrestrained exploration can be a valuable learning opportunity.

<h2 id="breaking">Breaking Can Be Learning</h2>

<p>
  When I first started my job, I was scared to touch the equipment. Each furnace was worth between $1-3 million, and the products they were processing at any given time were a similar amount. One wrong move and I just scrapped an entire lot. I timidly watched technicians do their work and made sure I wasn't touching anything that could get me in trouble.
</p>

<p>
  One day I had an epiphany: I would never learn or develop if I continued this way. This was coupled with a mentor's quote that I heard a mere few days later:
</p>

<blockquote>
  If you ain't breakin' shit, you ain't tryin'
</blockquote>

<p>
  Mark Zuckerberg has a similar quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Unless you are breaking stuff, you aren't moving fast enough
</blockquote>

<p>
  The following Monday my mindset—and with it, actions—changed immensely. I charged through hurdles, only stopping to ask when the risk was high enough that is risked moderate or severe consequences. I made changes I deemed required and important; I asked fewer questions and pushed ahead; I stopped waiting around for someone else to do things and made what I wanted to happen. It was exhilarating, like I had found the magic pill and secret recipe to productivity all in a single afternoon thought.

<h2 id="">[FINISH]</h2>

<p>
  There is an obvious fine line between being exploratory and being reckless; location differs based on risk, magnitude of impact, industry, etc. Regardless, this prompts the question: how much should one fuck around? How valuable is fucking around?
</p>

<p>
  The answer, based on my experience, is incredibly valuable.
</p>

<p>
  Multiple outcomes can be had from fucking around:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Finding out the correct way to do something by getting it right
  </li>
  <li>
    Finding out the correct way to do something by getting it slightly wrong and being corrected
  </li>
  <li>
    Finding out the correct way to do something by getting it catastrophically wrong and being corrected and/or punished
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The first outcome is obvious: do what you think is right, get it right, no harm done. Apply the identical solution to the problem the next time it arises.
</p>

<p>
  The second outcome
</p>

<p>
  The third outcome
