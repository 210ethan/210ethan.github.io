- Being trustworthy is part of my identity and I do not want that ruined
- identities:
  - [add in what qualifies as such identity. for example, clean is clean shaven, dressing, home, car, etc; trustworthy is I don't tell secrets, i keep promises, i don't exaggerate, etc]
  - hard working

- finding an excuse about why you violated your identity allows you to maintain your identity and continue to violate it > this is not good!

<p>
  As usual, LessWrong writers have beaten me to the punch on describing the benefits of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/identity">identities</a>. Some highlights and notes on each piece below.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTzxg7y5HFYBBWfBj/identities-are-subconscious-strategies">Identities are [Subconscious] Strategies</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  they also come with a number of perils. In particular, we are prone to a) become distressed by any perceived threat to an identity, and b) become utterly inflexible around shifting, modifying, or discarding identities.
</blockquote>

<p>
  These so-called perils can also be good. A threat to a "positive" identity (one that is generally good for us to have) can compel us to maintain or promote said identity against adversity. For example, if I'm known as a trustworthy person and do something that throws that into question, I will work extra hard in the future to regain said trust.
</p>

<p>
  Inflexibility in identities can be good for positive identities that have a failsafe mechanism in the form of a condition or trusted person. For example, if I'm known as a trustworthy person but take that to the extreme by following through on commitments to the detriment of my health, a friend or the bags under my eyes can let me know I'm taking it too far.
</p>

<blockquote>
  The degree of threat perceived is proportional to the importance of the goal and to the extent that the identity is sole strategy for achieving the goal.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  If threats to identity are really about threats to goal-attainment, then the key to working with identities becomes a) surfacing the hidden goals and, b) ensuring there is security around attaining those goals.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I'd argue most goals derived from an identity go back to either first principles ("I am X because X is important in and of itself") or status.

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zupr296Zy74wpihXT/use-your-identity-carefully">Use Your Identity Carefully</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  In Keep Your Identity Small, Paul Graham argues against associating yourself with labels (i.e. “libertarian,” “feminist,” “gamer,” “American”) because labels constrain what you’ll let yourself believe. ... Beliefs can constrain actions, but identity can also constrain actions directly. ... <b>Do you want to constrain your beliefs? No. ... Do you want to constrain your actions? Yes!</b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Identity is hard to change. Identity can be difficult to notice. Identity has unintended consequences. Use this tool only after careful deliberation. What would this identity do to your actions? What would it do to your beliefs? What social consequences would it have?
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR8c2NPp4bWHQ5u45/strategic-choice-of-identity">Strategic choice of identity</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  With identities, just like with habits, the easiest way to reduce or eliminate a bad one seems to be to install a new one that is incompatible with it.

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  I've chosen X identities to adopt over the course of several months. Each identity has its benefits (how does adopting this identity benefit me in life) and expected outcomes explicitly listed.
</p>

<p>
  Some thoughts that extend to all:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One possible outcome that extends to all is finding an excuse that allows me to violate an identity without social or personal repercussions and using it when convenient for me. I trust myself to not "cheat" in this manner, but mental gymnastics is a powerful thing that I've definitely committed in the past.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abiding by some identities may conflict with each other due to time, energy, or other external constraints. There will have to be a balance found when situations like this occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    I risk minor, or even major, mental turmoil if I grossly violate an identity. The aforementioned mental gymnastics may help to explain some instances away, but others may be unexplainable and thus troubling.
  </li>
</ul>
