<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Therapists claim their goal is for the client to "graduate" from therapy by resolving the issues that initially led them there or developing tools to help alleviate the issues. "Progress" is made during each appointment as the client gets closer to satisfying the graduation criteria.
</p>

<p>
  But the client graduating means one less paying client, and while some therapy practices have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard to graduation for the client's mental (and financial, depending on price per session) health, progress were slightly delayed? Or new issues opened up that didn't necessarily slow or halt progress in one area, but started at ground zero in another?
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Realtors claim their goal is for the client to find the home of their dreams. Together they tour many properties, discussing the pros and cons of each based on the client's desires. Once a home is identified, the negotiations between the two agents begin, a constant back-and-forth checking what each party is willing to concede to find a deal both are satisfied with.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting a good deal means money is taken out of the realtor's pockets since their commission is based on the selling price.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of trying to get the lowest possible price based on true market value, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/05/homes/nar-verdict-real-estate-commission-fee/index.html">realtors kept home prices artificially high</a> in order to maximize commissions? The buyer's agent is happy, the seller's agent is happy, the seller is happy, and the buyer doesn't know much better.
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  Personal trainers claim their goal is for the client to achieve their health-related goals through exercise, dieting, lifestyle changes, or some combination thereof. Comprehensiveness depends on the trainer and service level paid for; lower-tier clients may only get 1:1 time a few times a week, while higher-tier clients receive an entire exercise and meal plan "customized" for their goals, history, lifestyle, and genetics.
</p>

<p>
  But the client achieving their health goals means one less paying client, and while some personal trainers have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard for the client to progress and ultimately achieve their goals in a short, yet reasonable time period, they <a href="boredom2.html">preyed on the ignorant</a> to slow progress without making it obvious? The client may not notice, attribute the lack of progress to something they were doing wrong, or assume that getting fit just takes a really long time (hint: <a href="media/incentives/300.pdf">it doesn't</a>). The trainer can then continue to have consistent clients for a longer time than necessary.
</p>

<p>
  <b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>
  Dating coaches claim their goal is for the client to end up in a happy, healthy relationship. They attack the issue in a variety of ways: from wardrobe and grooming to conversation and body language to texting and date planning strategies. Feedback is provided on the client's after-action date report to allow them to tweak certain behaviors for the next date, be it the same person or a different one.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting into a relationship means one less paying client, and while some dating coaches have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of giving feedback they know would be helpful, they intentionally neglected to provide necessary criticism on their poor dress choices ("you dress fine with the cargo shorts and fedora, that's your personal style and the other person should appreciate that!"), their poor conversational skills ("just keep talking about yourself since you're so interesting"), and their poor sex appeal ("potential partners probably find your lifestyle of watching Netflix and playing video games super cool!"). The client chooses to believe the coach since they're the professional and have had much success with other clients in the past. They assume that something's wrong with the person sitting across the table because how could anything be wrong with them? The coach said they were a catch!
</p>

  <b>V</b>
</p>

<p>
  Healthcare professionals claim their goal is for the client to be or become healthy. Tests occasionally need to be used to determine health status,
