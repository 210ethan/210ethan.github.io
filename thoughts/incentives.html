<h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2>

<p>
  Providers working in service-based industries with misaligned incentives are likely to unconsciously behave in a manner than benefits them substantially more than the client they are serving. When faced with external accusations or internal realizations of said behaviors, they find ways to justify their behavior in order to continue it, often for financial security or benefit.
</p>

<p>
  The only way to prevent this is to align the client and provider's incentives with each other.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Therapists claim their goal is for the client to "graduate" from therapy by resolving the issues that initially led them there or developing tools to help alleviate the issues. "Progress" is made during each appointment as the client gets closer to satisfying the graduation criteria.
</p>

<p>
  But the client graduating means one less paying client, and while some therapy practices have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard to graduation for the client's mental (and financial, depending on price per session) health, therapists slightly delayed progress? Or new issues were opened up that didn't necessarily slow or halt progress in one area, but started at ground zero in another?
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Realtors claim their goal is for the client to find the home of their dreams. Together they tour many properties, discussing the pros and cons of each based on the client's desires. Once a home is identified, the negotiations between the two agents begin, a constant back-and-forth checking what each party is willing to concede to find a deal both are satisfied with.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting a good deal means money is taken out of the realtor's pockets since their commission is based on the selling price.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of trying to get the lowest possible price based on true market value, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/05/homes/nar-verdict-real-estate-commission-fee/index.html">realtors kept home prices artificially high</a> in order to maximize commissions? The buyer's agent is happy, the seller's agent is happy, the seller is happy, and the buyer doesn't know much better.
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  Personal trainers claim their goal is for the client to achieve their health-related goals through exercise, dieting, lifestyle changes, or some combination thereof. Comprehensiveness depends on the trainer and service level paid for; lower-tier clients may only get 1:1 time a few times a week, while higher-tier clients receive an entire exercise and meal plan "customized" for their goals, history, lifestyle, and genetics.
</p>

<p>
  But the client achieving their health goals means one less paying client, and while some personal trainers have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard for the client to progress and ultimately achieve their goals in a short, yet reasonable time period, the trainer <a href="boredom2.html">preyed on the ignorant</a> to slow progress without making it obvious? The client may not notice, attribute the lack of progress to something they were doing wrong, or assume that getting fit just takes a really long time (hint: <a href="media/incentives/300.pdf">it doesn't</a>). The trainer can then continue to have consistent clients for a longer time than necessary.
</p>

<p>
  <b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>
  Dating coaches claim their goal is for the client to end up in a happy, healthy relationship. They attack the issue in a variety of ways: from wardrobe and grooming to conversation and body language to texting and date planning strategies. Feedback is provided on the client's after-action date report to allow them to tweak certain behaviors for the next date, be it the same person or a different one.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting into a relationship means one less paying client, and while some dating coaches have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of giving feedback they know would be helpful, the coach intentionally neglected to provide necessary criticism on their poor dress choices ("you dress fine with the cargo shorts and fedora, that's your personal style and the other person should appreciate that!"), their poor conversational skills ("just keep talking about yourself since you're so interesting"), and their poor sex appeal ("potential partners probably find your lifestyle of watching Netflix and playing video games super cool!"). The client chooses to believe them since they're the professional and have had much success with other clients in the past. They assume that something's wrong with the person sitting across the table because how could anything be wrong with them? The coach said they were a catch!
</p>

<p>
  <b>V</b>
</p>

<p>
  Consultants claim their goal is for the client to improve their business. They keep track of their billable hours and charge the client accordingly at the end of the project, whether or not actual, tangible improvements were made (sure, short-term improvements can be measured, but what about long-term? I suppose the market would decide the firm's fate if they never brought long-term value, but irrationality exists even where it shouldn't).
</p>

<p>
  But the client improving their business potentially means they no longer need the consultant, resulting in lower revenue for the firm.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of trying to minimize working hours while maximizing potential profits and quality of work, the consultant intentionally slows down their work, creating more billable hours for them and their firm and retaining the client for even longer. The client assumes the consultant is working hard given their reputation, while switching costs may prevent switching to a competitor.

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>
  Money and lack of objectivity are the two common themes: providers want more money and can't be held accountable when goals aren't achieved in a timely manner.
</p>

<h3 id="money">Involvement of Money</h3>

<p>
  Money talks. Money makes people do things they wouldn't normally do. Money makes people turn a blind eye to their morals and justify behaviors they previously considered unthinkable. It's a no-brainer (to some people) to take free money provided the client nor one's future self getting harmed.
</p>

<p>
  Financial insecurity is associated with higher psychological distress because [FINISH]. Given how potentially insecure some of these roles are, it makes sense from a "survival" perspective to keep
</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Indeterminate Timelines</h3>

<p>
  Timelines can't always be objective, especially when they involve genetic or external factors that are out of either person's control. Clients lose weight at different paces, market dynamics change home prices quickly, everyone has preferences in dating partners. These hazy timelines allow the provider to justify taking longer than normal to accomplish the agreed-upon goal if their efficacy is questioned by the client. Combine this being said by the supposed expert with the ignorance of the client and the claim is much more believable.
