<h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2>

<p>
  Providers working in service-based industries with misaligned incentives are likely to unconsciously behave in a manner than benefits them substantially more than the client they are serving. When faced with external accusations or internal realizations of said behaviors, they find ways to justify their behavior in order to continue it, often for financial security or benefit.
</p>

<p>
  The only way to prevent this is to align both the client and provider's incentives with each other, i.e., the provider's benefits scale with the client's. I use five examples—therapists, realtors, personal trainers, dating coaches, and consultants—to illustrate the concept and offer alternative models that better align each party's incentives.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Therapists claim their goal is for the client to "graduate" from therapy by resolving the issues that initially led them there or developing tools to help alleviate the issues. "Progress" is made during each appointment as the client gets closer to satisfying the graduation criteria.
</p>

<p>
  But the client graduating means one less paying client, and while some therapy practices have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard to graduation for the client's mental (and financial, depending on price per session) health, therapists slightly delayed progress? Or new issues were opened up that didn't necessarily slow or halt progress in one area, but started at ground zero in another, prolonging the relationship?
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Realtors claim their goal is for the client to find the home of their dreams. Together they tour many properties, discussing the pros and cons of each based on the client's desires. Once a home is identified, the negotiations between the two agents (representing the clients, of course) begin, a constant back-and-forth checking what each party is willing to concede to find a deal both are satisfied with.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting a good deal means money is taken out of the buyer's agent's pockets since their commission is based on the selling price.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of trying to get the lowest possible price based on true market value, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/05/homes/nar-verdict-real-estate-commission-fee/index.html">realtors kept home prices artificially high</a> in order to maximize commissions for both sides? The buyer's agent is happy, the seller's agent is happy, the seller is happy, and the buyer doesn't know much better, saving the realtor's reputation.
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  Personal trainers claim their goal is for the client to achieve their health-related goals through exercise, dieting, lifestyle changes, or some combination thereof. Comprehensiveness depends on the trainer and service level paid for: lower-tier clients may only get 1:1 time a few times a week, while higher-tier clients receive an entire exercise and meal plan "customized" for their goals, history, lifestyle, and genetics.
</p>

<p>
  But the client achieving their health goals means one less paying client, and while some personal trainers have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of pushing hard for the client to progress and ultimately achieve their goals in a shorter, yet reasonable time period, the trainer <a href="boredom2.html">preyed on the ignorant</a> to slow progress without making it obvious? The client may not notice, attribute the lack of progress to something they were doing wrong, or assume that getting fit just takes a really long time (hint: <a href="media/incentives/300.pdf">it doesn't</a>). The trainer can then continue to have consistent clients for a longer time than necessary.
</p>

<p>
  <b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>
  Dating coaches claim their goal is for the client to end up in a happy, healthy relationship. They approach the issue in a variety of ways: from wardrobe and grooming to conversation and body language to texting and date planning strategies. Feedback is provided on the client's after-action date report to allow them to tweak certain behaviors for the next date, be it the same person or a different one.
</p>

<p>
  But the client getting into a relationship means one less paying client, and while some dating coaches have a waitlist, others don't, resulting in lower revenue.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of giving feedback they know would be helpful, the coach intentionally neglected to provide necessary criticism on their poor dress choices ("you dress fine with the cargo shorts and fedora, that's your personal style and the other person should appreciate that!"), their poor conversational skills ("just keep talking about yourself since you're so interesting"), and their poor sex appeal ("potential partners probably find your lifestyle of watching Netflix and playing video games super cool!"). The client chooses to believe them since they're the professional and have had much success with other clients in the past. They assume that something's wrong with the person sitting across the table because how could anything be wrong with them? The coach said they were a catch!
</p>

<p>
  <b>V</b>
</p>

<p>
  Consultants claim their goal is for the client to improve their business. They keep track of their billable hours and charge the client accordingly at the end of the project, whether or not actual, tangible improvements were made (sure, short-term improvements can be measured, but what about long-term? I suppose the market would decide the firm's fate if they never brought long-term value, but irrationality exists even where it shouldn't).
</p>

<p>
  But the client improving their business potentially means they no longer need the consultant, resulting in lower revenue for the firm.
</p>

<p>
  What if, instead of trying to minimize working hours while maximizing potential profits and quality of work, the consultant intentionally slows down their work, creating more billable hours for them and their firm and retaining the client for even longer. The client assumes the consultant is working hard given their reputation, while switching costs may prevent switching to a competitor.

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>
  Money and lack of objectivity are the two common themes: providers both want and need money and aren't always held accountable when goals aren't achieved in a timely manner.
</p>

<h3 id="money">Money</h3>

<p>
  Money can make people turn a blind eye to their morals and justify behaviors they previously considered unthinkable. Accepting money—provided neither the client nor one's future self gets harmed—is easily explained away.
</p>

<p>
  Financial insecurity is associated with higher psychological distress because [FINISH, CITE STUDIES]. Given how potentially insecure some of these roles are, it makes sense to keep a known-good source of money coming in.
</p>

[FINISH]

<h3 id="timelines">Indeterminate Timelines</h3>

<p>
  Timelines can't always be objective, especially when they involve genetic or external factors that are out of either person's control. Clients lose weight at different paces, market dynamics change home prices quickly, both sides in dating have preferences in partners. These hazy timelines allow the provider to justify taking longer than normal to accomplish the agreed-upon goal if their efficacy is questioned by the client. Combine this being said by the supposed expert with the ignorance of the client and the claim is much more believable, prolonging the predation.
</p>

<h2 id="alignment">Alignment</h2>

<p>
  A non-exhaustive list of options for both clients and providers.
</p>

<h3 id="clients">For Clients</h3>

<h4 id="solo">Go Solo</h4>

<p>
  Incentives are almost always aligned when a single person is involved. Most providers are hired due to their supposed expertise and the client lacking time/energy/ability to do the work themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Some options for each example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Instead of a therapist, pick up a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good:_The_New_Mood_Therapy">Feeling Good</a> and follow its guidance
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of a realtor, find an agent who does flat fees or title company that can guide you through the process of FSBO
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of a personal trainer, read the <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/">The Fitness Wiki</a>, follow its guidance, and post any questions on forums
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of a dating coach, learn how to dress well, get fit, live an interesting life, and how to hold a conversation
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of a consultant, collect and synthesize the data yourself learning methods from the internet
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In other words, get some <a href="agency.html">agency</a>. Comparative advantage is predicated on the opportunity cost being lower, but doesn't apply here if the supposed stallings are great enough in time or magnitude; people are better off picking up/finding/reading/learning/collecting themselves than they would be going to so-called experts that take advantage of them.
</p>

<h4 id="drop">Define Timelines or Drop 'Em</h4>

<p>
  Service-based jobs are always better when they're completed faster without sacrificing quality because the purpose is the destination, not the journey. Faster does not come without costs, though; work needed must often be more intense and more frequent to achieve similar results. However, compressing work in constant time may also be more efficient to the provider by reducing switching costs.
</p>

<p>
  If the job type is scalable in both time (more time spent on task per unit time) and intensity (more focus spent per unit time), then timelines can potentially be defined to hold the provider accountable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Therapy: Not necessarily scalable since thought patterns need raw time to adapt, but "Homework" in the forms of exercises can be done ad nauseam, especially if more reps is considered more beneficial
  </li>
  <li>
    Realty: Showing more homes gives more options to choose from and may avoid price increases if they are expected to do so
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal Training: Scalable in many directions (exercise, diet, recovery), especially for weight loss and trained athletes who can handle more volume. Training three times a week for 45 minutes will gain little to nothing, but some form of exercise every day for 60 minutes will gain something. Six months is also sufficient time to see substantial gains if the work is put in by both parties. (Yes, note that this is still somewhat constrained by time.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Dating: Scalable in many directions (fitness, dress, hobbies, time spent courting partners, number of dates) regardless of current position. Got fitness and dress down? Start pursuing others. Not able to get dates? Analyze the lack of results, get fitter, buy better clothes, and learn to converse.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consulting: Scalable in time spent on task by the consultant
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note these all require effort by both parties: the client can't sit around and expect the provider to get them results without them also working.
</p>

<h3 id="providers">For Providers</h3>

<h4 id="drop2">Define Timelines or Drop 'Em</h4>

<p>
  Providers can also drop clients, and should for moral and reputational reasons if progress is lackluster. If someone isn't progressing towards their goal under the provider's guidance despite substantial time, effort, and various methods, then that partnership may not be the best for the client (don't you remember they said they wanted what's best for you?).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Therapy: Declare the number of sessions and expected workload during the initial meeting: "we will have X sessions, each with an expected Y hours of homework between them. If either of us are unsatisfied with your progress at the end, this relationship will end so you can find someone better suited for your needs." This approach gives ample time for the client to fulfill their role and the provider to gauge progress while giving both an out if things are not satisfactory.
  </li>
  <li>
    Realty: Declare the goal of houses shown per time period to the client (more houses = more options to choose from)
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal Training: Define goals and give aggressive timelines of reaching them. Explain what sacrifices are needed to achieve said goals and ensure the client is willing to adhere to them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dating: Declare expectations for the client's self-improvement endeavors that correlate with dating success (do X by Y) and their time spent on dating-related tasks (approaching, time on dating apps, time spent messaging/texting/calling/on a date
  </li>
  <li>
    Consulting: Declare expected number of hours that the project will take and meticulously track them, all while allowing the client to audit as needed
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="both">For Both</h3>

<h4 id="reviews">Reviews</h4>

<p>
  Reviews generally improve performance of both parties because they expose the provider's efficacy to the public eye,

  so long as both have to agree to enter into a relationship: if the client sees the provider is good, they'll offer a contract; if the provider sees the client is good, they'll accept the contract. The missing piece in today's world is the fact that provider's often can't see the client's rating, nor do they care because their reputation is rarely at stake. By putting the provider's reputation on the line (which it always is when hired for a service) <i>and</i> being selective about their clients, both are encouraged to work hard to achieve the goal.
</p>

<p>
  It's the threat that works [FINISH, SOUTH PARK REFERENCE]
</p>

<p>
  One challenge is providers reviewing all of their clients on a platform that other providers can easily see. One solution is to only rate bad clients; if Alice has no reviews, then she isn't necessarily bad. (Of course, she may be atrocious but didn't get reviewed, leading to a rather unfortunate information gap for the next person she decides to hire.)
</p>




<h3 id="">For No One, or These May Not Work</h3>

<p>
  Charging flat fees can lead to promoting more sessions being booked: simply slow down progress during the first session so a second session is likely to be booked.
