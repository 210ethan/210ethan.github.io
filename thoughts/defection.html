<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>
  Brian Whitworth's <a href="https://brianwhitworth.com/5-6-social-defection/">Social Defection</a> sums up the concept well:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Every social synergy has a corresponding defection, e.g. in trade, when sellers can defect by false advertising, shoddy products or bad warranties, buyers buy less. Buyers can also defect, e.g. buy an expensive ball gown, wear it to a ball, then falsely request a refund, saying it did not fit. If many customers do that, sellers offer less, e.g. refuse refunds (also defect), even though refunds benefit both seller (more sales) and buyer (less risk).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  On a personal level it always pays to defect ... The idea that one can get something for nothing is the myth of our generation. All crime is essentially socially unsustainable.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  As more people defect, this increases the pressure on the remainder to also defect, etc. Hence a common reason given for cheating is that “everyone is doing it” (<a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/colleges/hclas/cld/cld_rlr_f04_cheating.pdf">Callahan, 2004</a>). A few defections can cause a chain reaction that destabilizes an entire social system.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Defection is acceptable in some cases where others aren't harmed (e.g., running a red light late at night with no one else nearby) and others are unlikely to defect in the same manner (e.g., sneaking into a construction site to explore without damaging things or being unsafe).

<h2 id="punishment">Punishment</h2>

<p>
  Defectors should be punished publicly, loudly, swiftly, and harshly for their wrongdoings. Stand up for what is right and defy what is wrong. Show forgiveness to accidental transgressions, but do not tolerate intentional violations.
</p>

<p>
  Is <a href="https://teachdemocracy.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-10-1-b-singapore-model-society-or-city-of-fear">Singapore the prime example of disincentivizing defection</a>?
</p>

<p>
  First, the result:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    After landing at Changi International, you will be impressed with the efficiency of Singapore's airport, called the finest in the world by the travel industry. You will have little trouble getting to your hotel, since Singapore has plenty of taxis, modern expressways, and a sleek new subway. You will soon notice that auto traffic is carefully regulated with well-disciplined drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you make your way through the city, you will be pleased with the squeaky clean streets lined with trees and flower beds. High rise apartment and office buildings help pack 3 million people into 240 square miles (about 12,000 citizens per square mile). You will not see any slums, homeless people, or beggars.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time you arrive at your hotel, you will be aware that almost everyone speaks some English. English is taught as the "first" language in the schools, and has become the common language for everyday communication. You will also learn that eating is a joy in Singapore with its many five-star restaurants. Even the city tap water is safe to drink. At night, you will have little fear as you stroll through Singapore's safe streets.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And second, the enforcement method:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Many of Singapore's laws are backed by stiff fines: failing to flush a public toilet ($100); spitting or smoking in public places ($300); eating or drinking on the subway ($300); littering ($600); selling chewing gum ($1600). The government came down against chewing gum after vandals began sticking wads on elevator buttons and subway car doors. Elevators in apartment buildings even have urine detectors that, when activated, take the violator's picture and lock the door until the police arrive. The fine is $1200.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more serious crimes, Singapore resorts to imprisonment and caning (beating with a stick). The death penalty is used in cases of first degree murder, armed robbery, and drug trafficking. Over 30 persons have been hanged since 1975 for drug offenses.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Much literature has been published on deterrence theory, the idea that the threat of punishment can deter crimes from being committed (up to a certain point). Further discussion will not be had here, but the question will be posed: what is the difference between cultures where deterrence theory works well and where it works poorly?
