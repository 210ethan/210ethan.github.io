<p>
  Brian Whitworth's <a href="https://brianwhitworth.com/5-6-social-defection/">Social Defection</a> sums up the theory well:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Every social synergy has a corresponding defection, e.g. in trade, when sellers can defect by false advertising, shoddy products or bad warranties, buyers buy less. Buyers can also defect, e.g. buy an expensive ball gown, wear it to a ball, then falsely request a refund, saying it did not fit. If many customers do that, sellers offer less, e.g. refuse refunds (also defect), even though refunds benefit both seller (more sales) and buyer (less risk).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  On a personal level it always pays to defect ... The idea that one can get something for nothing is the myth of our generation. All crime is essentially socially unsustainable.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  As more people defect, this increases the pressure on the remainder to also defect, etc. Hence a common reason given for cheating is that “everyone is doing it” (Callahan, 2004). A few defections can cause a chain reaction that destabilizes an entire social system.
</blockquote>
