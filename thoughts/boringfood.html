<p>
  Almost all food labels are attractive in some way: the font, color, description, shape. We're manipulated by the food advertising version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">Halo effect</a> and yet we never realize it when purchasing.
</p>

<p>
  What if labels were made both as boring and grotesque as possible to discourage consumers from buying said products?

<h2 id="adjectives">An Attractive Agglomeration of Adjectives</h2>

<p>
  Food and brand names are often euphonious (although it can be difficult to decouple what sounds good to the ear and what tastes good to the mouth): Chips Ahoy!, Gushers, Aunt Jemima syrup, Oreo, Reese's, Hershey's, Doritos, Cheetos, M&Ms, Little Debbie. Name a candy or snack food and it probably has a ring to it.
</p>

<p>
  The flavors and types sound equally as pleasant:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Fruit Roll-Ups: Blue Razzberry, Strawberry Blast, Tropical Tie Dye
  </li>
  <li>
    Little Debbie: Twinkies, Fudge Rounds, Cosmic Brownies, Oatmeal Creme Pie
  </li>
  <li>
    Mike and Ike: Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast, Red Rageous
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Alliteration and rhyming

  The FDA requires <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/labeling-and-warning-statements-tobacco-products/cigarette-labeling-and-health-warning-requirements">cigarette packages to be labeled with health warnings</a> in order to inform or remind users of the negative health consequences of smoking.
</p>

<p>
  Strong et al.'s <a href="media/boringfood/Effect%20of%20Graphic%20Warning%20Labels%20on%20Cigarette%20Packs%20on%20US%20Smokers’%20Cognitions%20and%20Smoking%20Behavior%20After%203%20Months.pdf">Effect of Graphic Warning Labels on Cigarette Packs on US Smokers’ Cognitions and Smoking Behavior After 3 Months</a> found the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Health concerns increased in all groups, with a significant increase in the GWL [graphic warning label] group vs the US pack group [just a standard U.S. cigarette pack with no GWL]
</blockquote>

<p>
  But the ultimate result was no change in smoking behavior:
</p>

<blockquote>
  At 3 months, there was no between-group difference in any smoking behavior. The blank pack group was similar to the US pack group on all measures.
</blockquote>

<p>
  With a small note that the finding "may enhance other tobacco control strategies to reduce cigarette smoking".
</p>

<p>
  Clark et al.'s <a href="media/boringfood/Impact%20of%20health%20warning%20labels%20on%20snack%20selection-%20An%20online%20experimental%20study.pdf">Impact of health warning labels on snack selection: An online experimental study</a> looked at both text-based and image-based warnings and found that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Health warning labels – particularly those including an image and text - have the potential to reduce selection of energy-dense snacks in an online setting. Their impact on selection and consumption in real-world settings awaits testing.
</blockquote>

<p>
  (It would be challenging to get a company to agree to real-world testing on their foods.)
