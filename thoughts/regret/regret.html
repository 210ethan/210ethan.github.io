<h1 id="regret">Regret</h1>

<h2 id="current">Current</h2>

<p>
  I spend a more-than-likely-unhealthy amount of time regretting past decisions. I think about past decisions that I made (or didn't make) multiple times a day, most of which make me criticize myself. I've tried to stop—or at least limit—this behavior, but it always comes back at some point. I try telling myself "there's no way I could have known", "you were just a dumb teenager", "some lessons have to be learnt that way". But I could have known, even as a dumb teenager, and some lessons don't have to be learnt in life. While some of those self-assurances are true and apply to some of my regrets, a majority of them were easily avoidable had I just taken some time to think about what I was(n't) doing.

  "There's no way I could have known". Sometimes you are just ignorant about things.

  I do wonder if my peers think about their regrets as often as I do mine. It's not something I would abruptly bring up to them nor them to me, but it seems like they outwardly have less regrets than I do.
