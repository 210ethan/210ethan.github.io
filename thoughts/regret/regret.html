<h1 id="regret">Regret</h1>

<h2 id="current">Current</h2>

<p>
  I spend a more-than-likely-unhealthy amount of time regretting past decisions. I think about past decisions that I made (or didn't make) multiple times a day, most of which make me criticize myself. I've tried to stop—or at least limit—this behavior, but it always comes back at some point. I try telling myself "there's no way I could have known", "you were just a dumb teenager", "some lessons have to be learnt that way". But I could have known, even as a dumb teenager, and some lessons don't have to be learnt in life. While some of those self-assurances are true and apply to some of my regrets, a majority of them were easily avoidable had I just taken some time to think about what I was(n't) doing.
</p>

<p>
  "There's no way I could have known". Sometimes you are just ignorant about things.
</p>

<p>
  I do wonder if my peers think about their regrets as often as I do mine. It's not something I would abruptly bring up to them nor them to me, but it seems like they outwardly have less regrets than I do.

<p>
  Below is a list of my non-compromising regrets in no particular order. Hopefully someone who reads this can learn from my mistakes and apply it to their own life. The lessons I wish to pass on come after the bolded "<b>Lesson</b>" in each item.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Regret</b>: Not spending more time with my parents during my six-month summer vacation before starting full-time work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sent home from school in March due to COVID-19 and started full-time work in September, giving me six months of free time to do whatever I pleased. I spent it writing this website, reading, exercising, playing video games with friends, and mindlessly browsing the web. I did spend time with my parents, though. We spent evenings together during the initial stage of the pandemic and went on the occasional dog walk in the woods. I rode mountain bikes regularly with my father on our home trails. And then my <a href="../death/death.html">father died unexpectedly</a> the week after I moved 5 hours away for my new job.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no telling that was going to happen, no indicators or forewarnings, which gives me a partial excuse. After all, you can't spend your life thinking this is the last time I could see this person, I should spend most of my waking hours with them. It's unrealistic and unhealthy. And yet, I could have done more. I could have put down the video games and gone to watch television with them. I could have said yes to more walks instead of reading. I could have said yes to more mountain bikes rides instead of [insert less meaningful activity here that I could do anytime in the future while away from my parents at my new job].
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I would be gone in September, only coming home to see them every 1-3 months during the holidays and a spontaneous weekend trip, but I still chose to spend my time on activities that were doable anywhere at anytime, a category that spending time with my parents does not fall under. And I will be racked with guilt for this, forever blaming myself for not doing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson</b>: Prioritize activities that aren't always available (e.g., experiences, spending time with family/friends) over those that are (e.g., media consumption, exercise). Ideally, these can be <a href="../time/time.html#multiple_activities">combined</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Regret</b>: Thinking my future self would be identical to my current self, causing doors to be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some doors are only open for a specific period of time, others become more difficult to open, and others remain open all the time. I made the mistake of planning my future around my current self's interests and plan, not taking into account that my interests could radically change. This causes one big issue: Time can be wasted delving into interests that have small likelihood of paying out, where that likelihood is only meaningful if you spend a significant amount of time on the interest. For example, wanting to become a musician for a living requires hours and hours of practice while the likelihood of "making it" remains unfathomably small. Hundreds of hours spent on something for "no" return. (A few notes on this point, as I'm sure some readers will disagree. 1) My current risk tolerance is rather low, hence my advocating for putting eggs (interests) in different baskets (time devoted to each). 2) There is not necessarily no return. You probably had fun, met people, developed some valuable skills, etc., but in the end the ultimate goal did not come to fruition. 3) You never know what will happen. While that shouldn't deter you from following a dream, you should be practical in its pursuit and understand the probabilities associated with reaching said dream.)
    </p>
    <p>
      My <a href="../../knowledge/year/year.html">year review</a> process helps me to keep track of how I change throughout the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson</b>: Don't assume you will be the same person in X years. Interests and circumstances change regularly, and you should be fluid with them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Regret</b>: Not spending money and missing out on experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is to be lived for experiences and money is a means to an end (experiences), not a means unto itself. When I was younger, I was stingy with money—not frugal, stingy. I would eat at home before going out with friends, opted out of multiple road trips partially due to wanting to save money (among other reasons), and so on. As demoralizing as it is, money is often the gateway to experiences. While have bumped my mindset up a rung to the "frugal" category, I am much more liberal about putting money towards experiences and good causes. Frivolous purchases still stay off my list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson</b>: Spend money towards experiences. The money will not be missed in years to come, but the regret of <i>not</i> spending it will be.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Regret</b>: Not enjoying childhood (up to end of college) more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 8th grade, I spent the entire year training to set the school's 1600 m run record. I went to bed around 8:30pm, woke up at 4:30-5:00am to train, then did it all again the next day. I got around two hours of free time every night after getting home from basketball practice, but these were tediously spent on homework I wasn't able to finish in class. I declined sleepover invitations because I needed the sleep for recovery, which in turn sacrificed friendship development. Grades 9-10.5 (as in up to the first semester) weren't much different. I ran cross country and track, which required similar bedtimes and wake up times. I had more fun during these years, but not as much had I not participated as seriously (not participating at all would leave me primary-friend-group-less, bringing the fun much closer to zero). Grades 10.5-12 were more fun, but at the cost of poor choices that won't be discussed. Grades 13-16 (university years) were spent studying for good grades and working for good experience. These years I don't regret as much as the other ones: they mattered much more than the others. My grades and job got me an internship at the powerhouse company I now work for full-time and I <a href="../aggiefab/aggiefab.html">thoroughly enjoyed my job</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson</b>: Enjoy the period in your life that isn't consumed by responsibilities or busy time. Sadly, this appears to be only childhood and retirement, one of which is gone never to return, the other many years away. Take the occasional step back and see if what you're doing is bringing as much value to your life as you'd like, and if not, what you can do to improve that.
