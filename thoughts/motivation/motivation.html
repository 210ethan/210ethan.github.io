<h1>Motivation</h1>

  Motivation is fickle. Some days we can't contain our excitement at doing things; we hop out of bed at the first sound of the alarm and rush to work, staying in the same intense state of focus for hours on end without looking at the clock. But on other days we hit the snooze and procrastinate in order to avoid the work we found so interesting only just a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
  Why is this? What can one do to get that desire back, even if only for a few moments?

  Motivation stems from both interests and purpose.

  Say someone is interested in a hobby, like computer programming and hardware. They discover the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi</a> and learn about all the <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/21862/raspberry-pi-top-projects-to-try-yourself">cool things</a> that are possible with it.
