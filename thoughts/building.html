<h1 id="building_creating_developing">Building/Creating/Developing (BCD)</h1>

<p>
  A core tenet of my life philosophy is that creating, building, and developing often, but not always, leads to a fulfilling and satisfying life. While these three verbs are similar, they are also distinct. Creation is the forming something from nothing. Building is the forming of something from pre-existing materials. Developing is the continual improvement of creations or buildings.

<h2 id="creativity">Creativity</h2>

<p>
  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>, the pyramid's tip consists of nouns that are primarily subjective to the person, while varying wildly across persons as a wholeâ€”this is referred to as self-actualization, or achieving one's full potential. Morality differs between people, where person A thinks X is an egregious offense and B deems to okay; creativity comes in different forms, such as art or writing; spontaneity is present or not-so-present in people; problem solving can be applied across a spectrum of different problems; building mountain bike stunts is arguably the only absolute... ("Acceptance of facts" is covered up by my entry.)

<p>
  BCD often encompasses many of the self-actualization components. Some believe it's moral to dispense as much free knowledge as possible. Person A creates or builds a project as open-source for the world to see and develop. Creativity is required to create or build, some projects (this website) needing more than others (SpaceX). Problem solving is needed for all aspects. How to create/build in general, and then for optimality or efficiency? Where should this project lead, and how to develop it along the way to get it there? Accepting when something can't be built nor created
