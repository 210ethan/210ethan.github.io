<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Tyson Gay, one of the best 100 and 200 meter sprinters of all-time, tested positive for banned substances in 2013. His suspension from events lasted one year and he was only stripped of medals earned one year prior to the doping conviction.
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Lance Armstrong, one of the best cyclists of all-time, admitted to knowingly using banned substances in 2013. He was stripped of all titles. He still currently operates a successful bicycle shop and has sponsors for his podcast.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

<h2 id="issue">The Issue</h2>

<p>
  These punishments are too lax because the absolute expected value of wrongdoing is often higher than the absolute expected value of being caught and convicted.
</p>

<p>
  The only way Gay and Armstrong could compete at the highest levels was by doping, and by competing in those tiers, sponsors threw gross amounts of money at each of them. When the USADA released their report on Armstrong, the sum total of sponsorships he lost was $75 million. His reported peak net worth was $125 million. In the end, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/lance-armstrong-agrees-pay-5-million-settle-false-claims-allegations-arising-violation-anti">he settled for $5 million</a> (of course, there were significant legal costs along the way).
</p>

<p>
  Drivers continue to risk driving under the influence primarily because, well, they're intoxicated. The risk of getting caught is fairly low (<a href="https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/2/158">one in 200</a>) and the inconvenience and cost of getting an Uber to/from the venue is enough to deter responsible behavior.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>
  The solution is simple: make the expected cost—both monetarily and socially—of wrongdoing so high that there is no considering going down the wrong path.
</p>

<p>
  Some examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Doping or cheating: Lifetime ban; forfeit all titles; repay all prize money won related to any competition with certain time period; loss of all sponsorships with no ability to regain any
  </li>
  <li>
    DUI: Lifetime ban of driver license; $[mean value of damage caused by DUIs, valuing each life at some amount of money] fine
  </li>
  <li>
    Academic dishonesty: Kicked out of university; incident recorded on permanent record that is shared amongst universities
  </li>
  <li>
    Targeting (as in American football): Lifetime ban; loss of all sponsorships with no ability to regain any
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Changing the social ramifications of these types of wrongdoings is challenging. People understand the <i>why</i> of these acts—that won't go away or necessarily change. Changing the <i>reaction</i> to the act can change. Painting these people as selfish, heartless, corrupt, and/or evil can catch on if the campaign is sustained long enough with enough intensity.
</p>

<p>
  Punishments should apply solely to "optional" actions and not those that are done for physical or mental well-being.
</p>

<p>
  As an addendum, some <a href="https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/deterrence.pdf">deterrence theory</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The works of Beccaria, Bentham, and Becker led to a theory of criminal deterrence involving a three-pronged approach in which certainty, celerity, and severity of punishment work together to increase the cost of an action so that a rational person will determine that the cost outweighs the benefit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certainty applies to the likelihood of being caught. The threat of a severe punishment is not effective if there is no possibility of ever being caught.
  </p>
  <p>
    Celerity applies to the speed of a consequence. A punishment imposed immediately after an offense is more effective than one that is imposed years after the offense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Severity of punishment is a necessary component since a rational person might commit a crime that brings a benefit even if punishment is swift and sure when the punishment is insignificant. In addition, the punishment serves as an example to others in society so that everyone is aware that a certain action is unacceptable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under the economic theory of deterrence, an increase in the cost of crime should deter people fro committing the crime, and there is evidence that individuals who believe they are likely to be arrested and punished are less likely to commit a crime than those who do not expect to be captured or punished. To increase the cost, the government can increase the likelihood that a person will be caught, the speed with which a person receives a punishment, or the severity of that punishment.
  </p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>
  Some of the punishments above are exactly what the Founding Fathers wanted to avoid with the eighth amendment, but what's cruel and unusual to one individual is justified and right to another. Of course, no innocent person should be punished per Blackstone, so some qualifications related to the wrongdoing must be established.
</p>

<p>
  First, the act must be obvious and intentional with no question as to their guilt. A drunk driver obvious and intentionally got into the car, turned it on, and drove. Punishments are divided into gradations based on how intentional the act appears. When in doubt, the less severe option is applied.
</p>

<p>
  Second, the accused cannot claim ignorance à la Gay or Rupp [CITE]. There are obviously exceptions to this, but taking unknown substances and blaming it on the coach is not a valid excuse. The accused must take responsibility to ensure they are not breaking any rules. Proving they did their due diligence and still broke the rules may qualify for a less severe punishment.
</p>

<p>
  Third, [FINISH]

<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>

<p>
  Now, let's see how effective this concept is in practice by looking at a few case studies.
</p>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  Duterte drugs
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  Singapore gum and whatnot
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  [FINISH, find another extremely strict place]
