<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  This essay is focused on improving organizational cultures, as opposed to societal cultures.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  A factory is organized by engineering and manufacturing teams, each with their own subteams and structures. The president, Andrew, is ultimately responsible for the factory's overall performance, including cost, throughput, safety violations, etc. While he assumed this role with already-established vice presidents (VP) in place, he does have the ability to subtly transform and influence others' behaviors—both direct and indirect reports—using his position of power.
</p>

<p>
  Andrew uses fear and intimidation to get what he wants and imposes high expectations on his VPs, giving a veiled threat of poor performance ratings or little room for promotional growth if certain goals aren't met. As a result, the VPs are more "motivated" to achieve said goals and impose high expectations onto the VVPs they are over. This propagates down to the individual contributor (IC) role, where the V...P is constantly under the threat of a poor review or even demotion that they will do whatever they can to achieve goals, even if it means cutting corners or working their ICs to the bone.
</p>

<p>
  V...Ps are quick to blame others for obvious problems because it deflects blame from themselves and improves the chances of not getting a poor review (but not necessarily a good one). ICs must fend for themselves because they have no one to blame for poor performance but themselves. Anyone pushing back against unfair or unreasonable treatment is subject to repercussions of those more powerful than themselves, and those more powerful have no reason to accept it because why would they?
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  The popular male friend group of the local high school includes Makatiel (the ring leader), Rashiel, Nathanael, Barakiel, and Badiel, and a handful of others with names that end in -el. It is exclusive and challenging to gain entry, but for good reason: they are all quite attractive with rich parents, get all of the girls' attention, and go to all of the parties. Makatiel, being the most attractive with the richest parents and the funniest jokes, calls the shots, and the others, who aren't quite as attractive nor rich nor funny yet still want to be included in the group because of its benefits, follow Makatiel's every move and order.
</p>

<p>
  And because Makatiel calls the shots, he can call the shot to excommunicate any member for any reason. No one will oppose him because all must oppose him, and not all will oppose him because of the immediate cutting off of the glorious benefits. The power dynamic plays well for Makatiel and poorly for the others, leading to a culture of ass-kissing and favor-doing to get on Makatiel's good side enough that they won't get the boot if they ever fuck up. (Hint: Makatiel expects the ass kisses and favors and doesn't keep count, so any fuck up is a net negative in his book, regardless of the true magnitude and past.)

<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<p>
  Undesirable, pour-down (there is no trickling here) cultures are often the result of power dynamics. More powerful people can impose their will onto those beneath them without fear of consequence, giving two distinct results.
</p>

<p>
  First, the less powerful can now impose their will on the less-less powerful, knowing they are safe from punishment because the all-powerful being both a) does the exact same thing, and b) expects the lower level impositions because they are doing it themselves. As shown in the first example, this pours down to the lowest levels of the organization, making everyone feel the pressure an almost equal amount except the one pouring it.
</p>

<p>
  Second, pushback is impossible or at least strongly discouraged due to the power dynamic. The more powerful will just remove, ignore, or criticize the less powerful.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>
  Good culture is subjective, but bad culture is often objective. Using fear, intimidation, and beratement is bad culture. Having the knee-jerk reaction of pointing fingers at others when things go wrong is bad culture. To make improvements, bad characteristics must be eliminated, allowing good characteristics to flourish on both an individual and organizational level.
</p>

<p>
  How can a sound, healthy culture be established that prevents abuse of its abiders by the issuers?
</p>

<h3 id="anonymous">Anonymous Reporting</h3>

<p>
  Bad culture violations should be allowed to be reported anonymously with zero risk of being identified. The panel that reviews these reports must have little to no conflicts of interest.
</p>

<p>
  Some options to become a panelist:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Be elected by a group of peers. Some cultures, despite being bad, ultimately produce better benefits than others. A public election risks that: peers can vote for the people they expect to [insert future benefit caused by some person here], making it worthless. Each vote should come with some sort of explanation, and preferably also proof, to back it up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get randomly selected. Conflicts of interest are still a risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use an independent company. To prevent any conflicts, they can be paid a flat fee upfront to be involved for a certain number of years, then the remaining money paid at the end. They are not allowed to be hired back ever again—this prevents skewing of results to gain favor with the company and improve chances of re-hire. (There are more factors to consider.)
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>
  Rigorous rules and laws should be put in place. Violations must carry appropriate and identical punishments, regardless of the offender's stature. Questionable violations (i.e., was a rule legitimately violated?) must be reviewed by a panel as outlined above.
</p>

<p>
  How rules are set is tricky. Those in power have incentives to make rules lax to allow leeway in either direction without violation, so long as they aren't (severely) negatively affected when a violation occurs.
</p>

<p>
  Some ideas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rules can be decided on today but put in place years into the future when none of the parties are still there. However, there's no telling what the organization will look like at that time, so the rule could be horrible for everyone. (This is one reason I hate the argument that politicians should keep their campaign promises—they should update based on the information they get, and if it's a bad decision, then they shouldn't have to follow through on it. This means campaign promises should probably be ignored.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules can be decided by a governing body or independent company. This is challenging because they must understand the already-existing culture, the business model, how any new rules will affect the business, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules can be proposed and anonymously voted on by affected parties. Votes can be weighted such that votes by those most affected by a rule count for more than those who aren't as affected.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="removal">Removal of Power Hierarchies</h3>

<p>
  Arguably the most radical of improvement options, removing the omnipresent power hierarchy and replacing it with a better alternative cuts the problem off at the source.
</p>

<p>
  Some ideas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Power is held by peers and performance reviews are held in a round-table-type setting. This eliminates an individual being subjected to their manager's culture, and instead now relies on their peers' culture. There is a much smaller chance all X of their peers hold the same philosophies, allowing a balance to be achieved if person A is on one end of the spectrum and person B on the other. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality">Crab mentality</a> is a risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define an objective scale to measure performance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodharting</a> is a major risk, requiring the scale to be well-defined and not game-able. Individuals must prove their claims of performance in order to collect the defined benefit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minor">Minor Options</h3>

<p>
  There are still minor, individual-level improvements that can be made without an entire policy changes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Push back on suggestions or requests that are unreasonable, unfeasible, or unintelligent. Explain why they are that adjective in a cordial manner, but do not humor them in any fashion with a "I'll check on that". Shut it down then and there with no room for negotiation.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a manager of others, encourage them to push back on your suggestions or requests that are unreasonable, unfeasible, or unintelligent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Blow whistles when gross violations of company policy have occurred. Do it as anonymously as possible to avoid retaliation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Remember that these improvements are not just for you, but your coworkers, too.
</p>

<h2 id="pessimism">A Pessimistic Outlook</h2>

<p>
  I do not think any of these improvement ideas will be implemented even if all the kinks were worked out. Modern-day organization still have a bottom line that is often directly correlated with performance, and if a bad culture still results in good metrics, then so be it. If the metrics aren't reached, then maybe something will change.
</p>

<p>
  A man can still dream (and fight).
