<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  This essay is focused on improving organizational cultures, as opposed to societal cultures.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  A semiconductor manufacturing facility, or fab for short, is organized by engineering and manufacturing teams, each with their own subteams and structures. The head honcho, Andrew, is ultimately responsible for the overall fab's performance, including cost, throughput, safety violations, etc. While he assumed this role with already-established vice presidents (VP) in place, he does have the ability to subtly transform and influence others' behaviors—both direct and indirect reports—using his position of power.
</p>

<p>
  Andrew uses fear and intimidation to get what he wants and imposes high expectations on his VPs, giving a veiled threat of poor performance ratings if certain goals aren't met. As a result, the VPs are more "motivated" to achieve said goals and impose high expectations onto the VVPs they are over. This propagates down to the individual contributor (IC) role, where the V...P is constantly under the threat of a poor review or even demotion that they will do whatever they can to achieve goals, even if it means cutting corners or working their ICs to the bone.
</p>

<p>
  V...Ps are quick to blame others for obvious problems because it deflects blame from themselves and improves the chances of not getting a poor review (but not necessarily a good one). ICs must fend for themselves because they have no one to blame for poor performance but themselves. Anyone pushing back against unfair or unreasonable treatment is subject to repercussions of those more powerful than themselves, and those more powerful have no reason to accept it because why would they?
</p>

<p>
  <b>II</b>
</p>

<p>
  The popular male friend group of the local high school includes Bobby (the ring leader), Charlie, Danny, Eddie, Frankie, and a handful of others with -ie or -y names. It is exclusive and challenging to gain entry, but for good reason: they are all quite attractive with rich parents, get all of the girls' attention, and go to all of the parties. Bobby, being the most attractive with the richest parents and the funniest jokes, calls the shots, and the others, who aren't quite as attractive nor rich nor funny yet still want to be included in the group because of its benefits, follow Bobby's every move and order.
</p>

<p>
  And because Bobby calls the shots, he can call the shot to excommunicate any member for any reason. No one will oppose him because all must oppose him, and not all will oppose him because of the immediate cutting off of the glorious benefits. The power dynamic plays well for Bobby and poorly for the others, leading to a culture of ass-kissing and favor-doing to get on Bobby's good side enough that they won't get the boot if they ever fuck up. (Hint: Bobby expects the ass kisses and favors and doesn't keep count, so any fuck up is a net negative in his book, regardless of the true magnitude.)
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<p>
  Undesirable, pour-down (because there is no trickling here) cultures are often the result of power dynamics. More powerful people can impose their will onto those beneath them without fear of consequence, giving two distinct results.
</p>

<p>
  First, the less powerful can now impose their will on the less-less powerful, knowing they are safe from punishment because the all-powerful being both a) does the exact same thing, and b) expects the lower level impositions because they are doing it themselves. As shown in the first example, this pours down to the lowest levels of the organization, making everyone feel the pressure an almost equal amount.
</p>

<p>
  Second, (and again, this was shown in both examples) retaliation is impossible or at least strongly discouraged due to the power dynamic. The more powerful will just remove, ignore, or criticize the less powerful.
</p>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>
  Good culture is subjective, but bad culture is often objective. Using fear, intimidation, and beratement is bad culture. Having the knee-jerk reaction of pointing fingers at others when things go wrong is bad culture. To make improvements, bad characteristics must be eliminated, allowing good characteristics to flourish on both an individual and organizational level.
</p>

<h3 id="anonymous">Anonymous Reporting</h3>

<p>
  Bad culture violations should be allowed to be reported anonymously with zero risk of being identified. The review panel must have little to no conflicts of interest.
</p>

<p>
  There are a few options to become a panelist:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Be elected by a group of peers. Some cultures, despite being bad, ultimately produce better benefits than others. A public election risks that: peers can vote for the people they expect to [insert future benefit here], making it worthless.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get randomly selected. [FINISH]
  </li>
