<h1 id="ambition">Losing Ambition</h1>

  Maybe it's availability bias, but I feel like I notice a fair amount of adults over the age of 40 express regret at not having done the things they wanted to while they had the chance. It's the "had the chance" part that makes me grimace a bit. Sure, there are sometimes barriers that can't be overcome&mdash;financial, familial, etc&mdash
