  Maybe it's availability bias, but I feel like I notice a fair amount of older adults (say 40+ years-old) express regret at not having done the things they wanted to while they had the chance. It's the "had the chance" part that makes me grimace out of pity. Sure, there are sometimes barriers that can't be overcome&mdash;financial, familial, etc&mdash
