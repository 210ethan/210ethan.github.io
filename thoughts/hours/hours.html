<h1 id="hours">I Work X Hours&mdash;What About You?</h1>

<p>
  Bragging about hours worked per week seems to have become commonplace and is virtually proportional to one's self-worth, both to the company and absolutely. (This is not to say that working long hours isn't valuable: it can be, especially if the employee is taking care of <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-mergers-and-acquisitions-law-you-sometimes-hear-the-term-gating-issue-What-is-a-gating-issue">gating items</a> or is one themselves, i.e., they are the only one that can perform a task (this points to poor management and structure, but that's for another discussion).) But why are people so proud about working so much when there's no requirement or urgency to do so?

  I was semi-guilty of this once. During my time at <a href="../aggiefab/aggiefab.html">AggieFab</a>, I found pride in telling people I worked 20 hr/week on top of my academic obligations. And while I never brought it up of my own accord, I was not shy about mentioning the 20 hr/week part when people asked about what I do. Why?
