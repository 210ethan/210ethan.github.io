<h1 id="cheating">Cheating</h1>

<p>
  In December 2020, a story broke about my <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/16/texas-am-chegg-cheating/">former university "investigating 'large scale' cheating"</a>. This came as no surprise, both because of COVID's forcing many classes online and because, well, college students cheat. The former reason is (hopefully) exclusive to 2020 and 2021, but the latter is as old as the university itself.
</p>

<p>
  Here I examine why students cheat and what universities can do to stop it, both online and when classes inevitably return to being held in-person.
</p>

<p>
  Before doing so, cheating should be defined so there's no ambiguity. TAMU <a href="https://library.tamu.edu/services/library_tutorials/academic_integrity/academic_integrity_5.html">defines</a> cheating as:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids or other devices or materials in any academic exercise.
</blockquote>

<p>
  This definition is at least impractical, if not flawed. Assuming the professor authorizes such materials, am I to contact him every time I am about to open a reference website to help on my homework? (I have a feeling this definition is ambiguous to cover the university and give them the upper-hand.)
</p>

<p>
  Cal Poly's <a href="https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating">definition</a> is a bit better, although still general:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Cheating is defined as obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain credit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by any dishonest or deceptive means.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The difference in the two is the inclusion of "dishonest" and "obtain credit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance". While dishonest is technically subjective, it is much closer to objective in the context of cheating. And cheating is dishonest. The cheater is claiming they:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Did the work that they didn't
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the material in proportion to the grade they received (100% means you understand the material well, 50% not so well)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  No matter how many backflips one does during their mental gymnastics, cheating is wrong. There is no way to justify it.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<h3 id="priorities">Priorities</h3>

<p>
  College is a difficult time for some. They load up on courses to meet their scholarship requirements, work a part-time job to make ends meet and keep student loans at bay, are involved in organizations, and have other priorities. While coursework should be near the top of their priority list (after all, that's the reason they're going to school (there's the case to be made that they're going for signaling, but that's for another time)), sometimes it falls short. And when it falls short, some opt for the easy route of cheating.
</p>

<p>
  After all, that health course exam you have to take doesn't <i>really</i> matter, and you have plenty of homework and projects in your four engineering courses, and you have work every night until 10:00pm this week, and you have to do research as part of your capstone project, and ...
</p>

<p>
  Some of those obligations really are more important than that health exam. Engineering courses are your focus, you need money to live, you need to do research to graduate. You don't <i>need</i> to know that Alzheimer's disease is more prominent in white women than white men.
</p>

<p>
  Solution: Continue prioritizing until cheating is not a consideration.
</p>

<h3 id="laziness">Laziness</h3>

<p>
  On the other hand, some college students are just lazy and don't want to do the work, choosing the most easy route possible. The types of people discussed in the <a href="#priorities">priorities</a> section could also be considered lazy, as they are not honestly committing to what they signed up for.
</p>

<p>
  Solution: These types of people likely cannot be fixed.
</p>

<h3 id="lack_understanding">Lack of Understanding</h3>

<p>
  A derivative of laziness, some students have a challenging time understanding the material, and prefer the easy route of cheating than spending countless hours studying. Coupled with priorities, one can justify the use of cheating as "this takes too long to learn and I just don't have the time".
</p>

<p>
  Solution: Spend more time studying or accept the grade you will get. College is not for everyone, especially some of the more challenging majors.
