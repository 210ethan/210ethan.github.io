<h1 id="bubble">Living in My Bubble</h1>

<p>
  Experiences living in my own communal bubble with the occasional adventure outside of it.
</p>

<p>
  A few notes before beginning:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    This post assumes IQ is heritable and a legitimate measure.
  </li>
  <li>
    At no point am I meaning to belittle or demean others or boast about myself. This will be reiterated throughout.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="curve">The Bell Curve</h2>

<p>
  Herrnstein and Murray's thesis of <i>The Bell Curve</i> was that society is becoming increasingly stratified by intelligence, with the Cognitive Elite forming the most successful group and the non-Cognitive Elite forming the others.
</p>

<p>
  The third paragraph of Part I—titled "The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite"—puts it aptly:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Cognitive stratification takes different forms at the top and the bottom of the scale of intelligence. ... In Part I, we look at the top. Its story line is that modern societies identify the brightest youths with ever increasing efficiency and then guide them into fairly narrow educational occupational channels. These channels are increasingly lucrative and influential, leading to the development of a distinct stratum in the social hierarchy, which we hereby dub the Cognitive Elite. The isolation of the brightest from the rest of society is already extreme; the forces driving it are growing stronger rather than weaker. Governments can influence these forces but cannot neutralize them.
</blockquote>

<p>
  While I do not consider myself part of the Cognitive Elite (despite what my mom told my countless times when I was growing up), I do consider myself smarter than average and part of on of the smarter strata. (To clarify, smarter = more intelligence &#8800; more knowledgable.)
</p>

<p>
   I also consider myself lucky and fortunate in many other ways, both genetic and non-genetic:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Healthy at birth with no complications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grew up in a safe, middle-class part of a well-developed, major U.S. city.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both parents had a strong marriage and showed love and care for me during my childhood.
  </li>
  <li>
    My father had a stable, well-paying career that provided food and shelter for our family.
  </li>
  <li>
    My mother was a homemaker and spent significant amounts of time with me and my brother.
  </li>
  <li>
    I went to a reputable university and graduated debt-free with a valuable degree (B.S. in electrical engineering).
  </li>
  <li>
    I have an well-paying career at a stable, reputable company.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Most of my core group of friends also have very similar experiences. All grew up in fairly nice areas with married parents who have stable jobs, attended a higher education institution for some amount of time, and currently work at some job. I have few friends/acquaintances who deviate very far from my situation. Sure, there are the extreme outliers from middle or high school who end up on the bottom extreme, but most of my friends are right up around me.
</p>

<p>
  I first noticed this during my second year of high school, when students began having more options for pre-AP (Advanced Placement) and AP courses. The same 100 or so kids (out of a 730 graduating class two years later) all took the same (pre-)AP courses, never opting for a "regular" (no AP in the course title) course. Besides electives that didn't offer an AP option, I never took a regular course past second year. Like others, the reasoning was two-fold: taking AP classes provided a 1.15x or 1.29x GPA multiplier and doing well on the AP exam provided college credit. This pattern continued throughout the next two years, culminating at the graduation ceremony. The Latin honors went first: I knew every summa cum laude, almost every magna cum laude, a decent amount of the cum laude, and very few non-honors. Other summa friends had the same experience. I'm sure the converse was true, too: non-honors students probably knew very few of the honors (but still a minority of the non-honors due to the sheer size).
</p>

<p>
  This phenomena extended to my time at university. While the less intelligent were quadruple filtered by the requirements to get into the university, then the College of Engineering, then the electrical engineering department, and finally the rigor of the courses, strata were still formed within the already-cognitively-advanced population. Some students stood out in the more difficult courses, becoming a beacon for confused students to ask questions and get help. When the Latin honors graduates were announced, I knew a majority of all three tiers.
</p>

<p>
  The filters and stratification do not stop with schooling, continuing on to career choices. As Herrnstein and Murray discuss:
</p>

<blockquote>
  To be a first-rate lawyer, you had better come from the upper end of the cognitive ability distribution. The same may be said of a handful of other occupations, such as accountants, engineers and architects, college teachers, dentists and physicians, mathematicians, and scientists.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Companies filter applications by intelligence through GPA requirements, IQ tests, and sometimes even alma mater. High promotions are determined not by time spent with the company, but by contributions made, which are often dependent on intelligence.
</p>

<p>
  It's disconcerting realizing there are categories <i>way above</i> my own and <i>way below</i> my own that I'll virtually never interact with. As Herrnstein and Murray put it:
</p>

<blockquote>
  This does not mean that a member of the cognitive elite never crosses paths with a person with a low IQ, but the encounters that matter tend to be limited. The more intimate or more enduring the human relationship is, the more likely it is to be among people similar in intellectual level.

  The same experience can be found of those on the bottom of the cognitive totem pole.
