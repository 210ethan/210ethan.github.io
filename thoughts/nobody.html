  While I had been considering this concept before I read the following, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/rp6crb/comment/hq2pf76/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">this comment</a> really drove my thoughts home:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Beware of climbing what I call, "passive status hierarchies." It's okay to be motivated by status, but be aware of what hierarchy you're within, who within that hierarchy ultimately serves as the status decider, and most importantly, decide if the people within that structure are people - and the type of people - you want to earn status with.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's really natural and common to find yourself within some social structure and to begin taking actions to raise your status without even realizing what you're doing. This can lead to some pretty weird and suboptimal life decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Commonly, this looks like pursuing a career in academia because your peers are mainly students, and they are pursuing a career in academia, so naturally, you should do the same thing because if you were to succeed, your status would go up.
  </p>
  <p>
    ...or, climbing the corporate ladder in a department/field you don't care about and don't see yourself doing long-term.
  </p>
  <p>
    ...or, grinding rank/elo in a game because you like the idea of people respecting the color of your avatar's frame.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And then I asked myself: does anyone else <i>really</i> care about you achieving those things? The answer is probably no.

and most of the time the people you're trying to impress don't care: guys going to gym for girls
