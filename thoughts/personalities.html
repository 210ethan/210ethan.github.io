  <b>I: Verb</b>
</p>

<p>
  Alexander likes to travel. A lot. He's recently been to Europe, Asia, and South America, experiencing more restaurants and old churches and night clubs and languages and history than most people experience in their lifetime. He has a travel credit card and all the other features "every traveler needs": Global Entry membership, a nice pair of headphones, a sleek backpack and carry-on.
</p>

<p>
  But all he talks about is travel. He relates anything he hears or see or smells or tastes or feels back to one of his previous trips. "Bro, back in China they had something similar but it was so much better". "Yeah, this stuff is pretty cool but the stuff in Chile is cooler."

  <b>I: Adjective</b>

  Beatrice likes to travel. A lot. She's recently been to Europe, Asia, and South America, experiencing more restaurants and old churches and night clubs and languages and history than most people experience in their lifetime. She has a travel credit card and all the other features "every traveler needs": Global Entry membership, a nice pair of headphones, a sleek backpack and carry-on.
</p>

<p>
  But she rarely brings up her travel unprompted. When she does, it's not to talk about the travel itself, but to share specific parts that were memorable for her. "When I was in Mexico, I really appreciated the patience the locals showed when I tried to speak Spanish." "I love the feeling of satisfaction you get from mission trips. I went on one to Bosnia and it was a great experience."
</p>

<p>
  <b>II: Verb</b>
</p>

<p>
  Carson likes to ride his bike. A lot. He rides almost every day, races every few weekends, and takes vacations to go mountain biking in the mountains. His evenings are spent watching cycling videos on YouTube and reading Pinkbike. He has all the best gear, from his shoes to power meter to bib to computer to helmet. His water bottle and bike rack are plastered in cycling-related stickers.
</p>

<p>
  But all he talks about is cycling. His standard response to "how was your weekend?" is about some sick trail he shredded or the new part he got for his bike. There's not much
</p>

  <b>II: Adjective</b>
