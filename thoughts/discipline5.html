<h2 id="time">The Math Doesn't Add Up</h2>

<p>
  I often see time being lumped into two major categories, where the actual categorization is flexible and subjective: productive and unproductive. Productive activities include exercise, writing, working on side projects, reading, and chores. Unproductive activities include video games, watching television, watching YouTube/TikTok, and browsing Reddit.
</p>

<p>
  Most self-improvers—and probably people in general—understandably want to a) minimize unproductive time, and b) maximize productive time, but make the grave mistake of believing that every minute of unproductive time removed equals one minute of productive time gained. They install website blockers, sell their television, and delete accounts into order to remove these so-called toxic activities from their lives without realizing that unproductivity will manifest itself in other ways
