<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I often struggle completing things that I know I <i>should</i> do, but don't have the desire to due to a better alternative or just plain not wanting to. I know I should exercise, but it's late and I only got four hours of sleep last night. I know I should go grocery shopping to avoid eating out, but it's an inconvenience and paying the $15 for some delicious food is so much easier. I know I should do X, but Y. This pattern will continue for eternity, and it's not exclusive to me.
</p>

<p>
  This is not to say those Xs are inherently unenjoyable activities. Sometimes slumps are had, valleys of motivation with the productive, exciting mountain far in the distance. This doesn't negate the fact that some activities are just plain better than others and should be done, regardless of how Y one is.
</p>

<p>
  This essay looks at ways to spur one into action. Note that not all of these are healthy, but they work in my experience.
</p>

<h2 id="shame">Shame</h2>

<p>
  Shame is a powerful motivator for some, a terrible one for others. Those part of the latter group can skip this section and should spend the time examining why they don't hold themselves to some standard.
</p>

<p>
  Shame often follows failing to achieve some standard, whether self-imposed or societally-imposed. These standards are directly tied to expectations: someone has some expectation and failing to live up to it results in shame.
</p>

<p>
  Wielding this is simple: establish expectations for anything that's undesirable to do. Making personal goals and the fact that they <i>will</i> be completed widely known to the public is one method. Holding oneself to a personal standard of conduct is another.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="conceit">Conceit</h2>

<p>
  Having a high opinion of oneself, especially relative to enemies, can ignite action quickly through a few simple questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Would this person do this?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes: Well I'm better than them, so I'm also going to do it, but better.
      </li>
      <li>
        No: That's because they're lazy/incompetent/unintelligent and I'm not, so me doing it proves I'm better.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Will I be [positive adjective]er than this person if I do this?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Competition is relevant here. Competition is about being better, being superior. If someone is truly competitive, they'll do what they need to to win, regardless of how uncomfortable it is.

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a> is the prime example of acting because of consequences. From the website:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Your goals can be anything quantifiable — weight, pushups, minutes spent on Facebook, points on Duolingo. Answer with your number when Beeminder asks — or connect a device/app below to auto-report — and we'll show your progress and a Bright Red Line to follow to stay on track. If you cross the line, we charge your payment method!

<p>
  Money is the best consequence option. It's immediately available, very valuable, doesn't negatively affect others, and is scalable. Within money, there are two suboptions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Burning it. This ensures it is completely put to waste and no good was done because of it. The problem with saying "I'll donate money to X if Y happens" is that it still provides satisfaction after the donation, except in one case (see the next option).
  </li>
  <li>
    Donating it to an "evil" organization. This can be a rival college sports team, contentious religion groups (e.g., Westboro Baptist Church), causes that are subjectively bad, etc. No good whatsoever can be discerned from the donation.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Personal trust to follow through on the burning or donating is of the utmost importance. A trustworthy accountability partner can also be chosen, but the money should be given to them in advance and rigorous conditions agreed upon.
