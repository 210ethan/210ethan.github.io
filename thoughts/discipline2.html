<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I often struggle completing things that I know I <i>should</i> do, but don't have the desire to due to a better alternative or just plain not wanting to. I know I should exercise, but it's late and I only got four hours of sleep last night. I know I should go grocery shopping to avoid eating out, but it's an inconvenience and paying the $15 for some delicious food is so much easier. I know I should do X, but Y. This pattern will continue for eternity, and it's not exclusive to me.
</p>

<p>
  This is not to say those Xs are inherently unenjoyable activities. Sometimes slumps are had, valleys of motivation with the productive, exciting mountain far in the distance. This doesn't negate the fact that some activities are just plain better than others and should be done, regardless of how Y one is.
</p>

<p>
  This essay looks at ways to spur one into action. Note that not all of these are healthy, but they work in my experience.

<h2 id="shame">Shame</h2>

<p>
  Shame is a powerful motivator for some, a terrible one for others. Those part of the latter group can skip this section and should spend the time examining why they don't hold themselves to some standard.
</p>

<p>
  Shame often follows failing to achieve some standard, whether self-imposed or societally-imposed. These standards are directly tied to expectations: someone has some expectation and failing to live up to it results in shame.

<h2 id="conceit">Conceit</h2>

<p>
  Having a high opinion of oneself, especially relative to enemies, can ignite action quickly through a few simple questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Would this person do this?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes: Well I'm better than them, so I'm also going to do it, but better.
      </li>
      <li>
        No: That's because they're lazy/incompetent/unintelligent and I'm not, so me doing it proves I'm better.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Will I be [positive adjective]er than this person if I do this?
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
