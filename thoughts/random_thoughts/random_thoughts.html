<h1>Random Thoughts</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to post thoughts I have.

<h2 id="july_2020">July 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Standardization across the world is important (e.g. metric vs. imperial system, etc). Low-cost changes will help everyone. An example is the way dates are written. Americans write it July 24, 2020 or 7/24/2020, whereas everyone else does 24 July 2020 or 24/7/2020. This can be confusing if both the day and month are 12 or less, e.g. 4/8/2020 could be either 8 April 2020 or 4 August 2020.

      One thing I hate about websites with commenting is the lack of accountability in responding to a criticism. Say someone posts a controversial take and I respond with a refutation. They and their followers can easily ignore it and stay safe in their echo chamber. It makes for poor discussion and no one understanding either side better. Taleb is a great example. Instead of engaging with people who refute his work, he immaturely resorts to calling them "idiots" and blocking them. Just look at public forums with open-mic Q&A. The presenter almost has to answer the question asked, and if they don't (or do, but poorly), everyone can see for themselves. Online, not so muchâ€”simply ignore and don't lose anything!
