<h1>Random Thoughts</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to post thoughts I have.
</p>

<h2 id="august_2020">August 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Taking time to fulfill someone's suggestion (watch this video, read this book, etc) shows you care about their opinion and is a powerful action.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is unacceptable when studies are cited by "(Morse 2020)". This leaves the burden on the reader to go search for the study, which is sometimes non-obvious. The original author should include the link (preferable) or the name at a minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Accidents are not forgivable if the offender didn't fully attempt to mitigate or eliminate the risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only tell people things you are absolutely okay with getting out. It will get out eventually.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="july_2020">July 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Companies should not play music while you are on hold. Just play the automated voice every X minutes to let you know you're still on hold.
  </li>
  <li>
    All book links should go to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. Goodreads provides links not only to Amazon, but also to 11 other stores (which sometimes have better prices than Amazon, but you should always use <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/">BookFinder</a>), as well as libraries. The users are also likely more reliable and well-read than Amazon's, but maybe I'm just an elitist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any link referencing a study or similar should point directly to that study. If not, then the site the link goes to should contain a link to the study. The deepest you should have to search is two links. Further, saying "scientific literature shows" without actually citing the studies makes you a horrible human being.
  </li>
  <li>
    Standardization across the world is important (e.g. metric vs. imperial system, etc). Low-cost changes will help everyone. An example is the way dates are written. Americans write it July 24, 2020 or 7/24/2020, whereas everyone else does 24 July 2020 or 24/7/2020. This can be confusing if both the day and month are 12 or less, e.g. 4/8/2020 could be either 8 April 2020 or 4 August 2020.
  </li>
  <li>
      One thing I hate about websites with commenting is the lack of accountability in responding to a criticism. Say someone posts a controversial take and I respond with a refutation. They and their followers can easily ignore it and stay safe in their echo chamber. It makes for poor discussion and no one understanding either side better. Taleb is a great example. Instead of engaging with people who refute his work, he immaturely resorts to calling them "idiots" and blocking them. Just look at public forums with open-mic Q&A. The presenter almost has to answer the question asked, and if they don't (or do, but poorly), everyone can see for themselves. Online, not so muchâ€”simply ignore and don't lose anything!
