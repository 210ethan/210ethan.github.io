<p>
  I think about the past every day. Some of it's things I regret and what I wish I had done differently or even at all. Some of it's reminiscing on childhood memories I wish I could relive. Some of it's using past decisions to guide future ones. It consumes an unhealthy part of my life, always being in the back of my mind and often in the forefront.
</p>

<p>
  Which leads to the questions: Is thinking about what's done and never-to-return healthy? What are the negatives associated with nostalgic thinking? Can nostalgic thinking be productive?

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  By definition, nostalgia is both pleasure and sadness from remembering the past. The pleasure is evoked from the good memories, the sadness from the fact that it's happened and will never get to be experienced again. The scale often tips in the direction of pleasure, but occasionally leans towards sadness. Regardless, the magnitude of each emotion generally scales proportionally to one another: immensely-happy memories produce similar amounts of sadness.
