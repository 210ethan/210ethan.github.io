  I think about the past every day. Some of it's things I regret and what I wish I had done differently or even at all. Some of it's reminiscing on childhood memories I wish I could relive. Some of it's using past decisions to guide future ones. It consumes part of my life, always being in the back of my mind and often in the forefront.
