<h2 id="daily">Daily</h2>

<p>
  I think about the past every day. Some of it's things I regret and what I wish I had done differently or even at all. Some of it's reminiscing on childhood memories I wish I could relive. Some of it's using past decisions to guide future ones. It consumes an unhealthy part of my life, always being in the back of my mind and often in the forefront.
</p>

<p>
  Which leads to the questions: Is thinking about what's done and never-to-return healthy? What are the negatives associated with nostalgic thinking? Can nostalgic thinking be productive?
</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  By definition, nostalgia is both pleasure and sadness from remembering the past. The pleasure is evoked from the good memories, the sadness from the fact that it's happened and will never get to be experienced again. The scale often tips in the direction of pleasure, but occasionally leans towards sadness. Regardless, the magnitude of each emotion generally scales proportionally to one another: immensely-happy memories produce similar amounts of sadness.

  Nostalgia can be invoked if planned for properly.

<h2 id="list">List</h2>

<p>
  This is a personal list of things that make me experience nostalgia.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Video games:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Modern Warfare 2: I put a whole bunch of hours on this game back in middle school (2009-2011). I would even text my girlfriend I was going to ride my bike so I could play uninterrupted haha. Played a bit less in high school, then every couple of months in college. This game holds a lot of fond memories (as I'm sure others do, too) for a lot of people (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu6HDd7gDr8">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUeu-FIRSJc">2</a>). I used to be <i>that</i> guy that boosted my friends for nukes in the back of Estate or in the hidden shack on Underpass. My favorite map was Wasteland, where I would camp C from either side with my thermal/FMJ Barrett and pick off people until I got my Harriers. A ton of shit-talking was had. My first nuke experience was on Skidrow a few days after the game came out and I was astounded at what just happened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skate 3: I remember playing this a lot during the summer between seventh and eighth grade at my friend E's house. We'd make custom parks and just skate around Port Carverton playing around. My favorite place was <a href="https://skate.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Ultra_Mega_Park">Super Ultra Mega Park</a> and the quarry. Some other fun parks. I also remember playing this with JR after the summer pool party. JW and his friend B (?) came over one time and I was showing off some cool tricks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Halo 3: Another one of my favorite games of all-time, played mostly from fifth to seventh grades and a bit in to high school. Team Objective and Squad Battle were my favorite game modes, but my highest rank was 49 (so close to the 50!) in Team Slayer. Lots of fun was had in the different events Bungie put on, like a Halloween-day infection playlist. I spent hours on Forge Mode creating custom maps and exploring the ones I had downloaded from file shares. Bungie Favorites gave some cool stuff, and I still remember the ones that remained frozen in time for the 10 years prior to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoZqYei0kUg">servers shutting down for good</a>. Custom games like Predator, Fat Kid (I think that was the name), Saw, Raccoon City, Hurricane Katrina, and others were played non-stop. My brother and I would always get excited at Standoff Heavy on Big Team Social (8 vs. 8) because the overpowered Gauss Warthog was available. I can't say I met too many strangers online, but I had some damn good times with my friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Halo 2: E, T, D, and I would have Halo Battles in the summer, our favorite maps being Headlong, Relic, and Waterworks (well, at least mine). Eventually I got too good at Halo 3 for us to continue the battles there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (incl. Warzone): This brings me back to COVID-19 quarantine times in March-August 2020. We played a lot of S&D as full teams with A, B, J, A, T, and myself, talking shit to every other team that we played (so long as we beat them). Warzone was a staple during the day and we got pretty decent at it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shaun White Snowboarding: I played this almost exclusively at E's house down the street during the winter of my sixth grade year. We listened to Sammy Adams and other up-and-coming rappers and hit some cool tricks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Midtown Madness 3: My brother and I played this non-stop and still use the catchphrase, "Onward, to the fourth dog show!" (at least I do). They had some awesome car skins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Need for Speed: Most Wanted: This was my go-to game for some time during third grade. I'd come home and do random races, trying to get enough money to maximize all my cars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Super Mario Sunshine:
      </li>
      <li>
        Rollercoaster/Zoo Tycoon: I played these non-stop in early elementary school. I recreated real-life rollercoasters, made death coasters, put guests in prison if they disliked my park, and got up to many more shenanigans. Zoo Tycoon was similar.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Movies:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Interstellar: I saw this late one evening in November 2014 at the HOAMC with FC. We both really enjoyed it and hung out afterwards talking about it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inception: I saw this at P with the F family the day before seventh grade started. We went to go eat at California Pizza Kitchen afterwards.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Music: There are too many songs to name, but they bring me back to certain periods in my life.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smell:
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a field in the forest by my childhood home. Certain flowers (?) run rampant in the summer and give off certain aroma that brings me back to high school summer mornings and running back there.
      </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
