  Alice has been overweight for as long as she can remember. Her parents both had unhealthy lifestyles that they passed down to her: family meals were generally takeout, activities included watching television or playing board games, and they never encouraged or necessitated any type of active outdoor activities. But now it's been getting to her. She's limited on activities she can do with her friends, got passed up for a promotion at work, and has had an unsuccessful dating life.

She's never learned to deal with hunger, instead always choosing to silence it with a snack. But she trusts the process and commits to it for 90 days.

But he notices colleagues who seem to be in the same positions genetically/opportunistically/upbringing-ly having success in the dating world.

<p>
  He takes a long hard look at himself and his situation and decides to change it. (I will avoid specific details as there may be some amount of controversy, but the idea is there.)

  After a few months of working on his appearance and life, he catches his first break when a woman approaches him. A month later, he catches another woman stealing some glances at him. Six months later and he's now
