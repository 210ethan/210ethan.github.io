<p>
  As usual, LessWrong writers have beaten me to the punch on describing the benefits of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/identity">identities</a>. Some highlights and notes on each piece below.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTzxg7y5HFYBBWfBj/identities-are-subconscious-strategies">Identities are [Subconscious] Strategies</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  they also come with a number of perils. In particular, we are prone to a) become distressed by any perceived threat to an identity, and b) become utterly inflexible around shifting, modifying, or discarding identities.
</blockquote>

<p>
  These so-called perils can also be good. A threat to a "positive" identity (one that is generally good for us to have) can compel us to maintain or promote said identity against adversity. For example, if I'm known as a trustworthy person and do something that throws that into question, I will work extra hard in the future to regain said trust.
</p>

<p>
  Inflexibility in identities can be good for positive identities that have a failsafe mechanism in the form of a condition or trusted person. For example, if I'm known as a trustworthy person but take that to the extreme by following through on commitments to the detriment of my health, a friend or the bags under my eyes can let me know I'm taking it too far.
</p>

<blockquote>
  The degree of threat perceived is proportional to the importance of the goal and to the extent that the identity is sole strategy for achieving the goal.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  If threats to identity are really about threats to goal-attainment, then the key to working with identities becomes a) surfacing the hidden goals and, b) ensuring there is security around attaining those goals.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I'd argue most goals derived from an identity go back to either first principles ("I am X because X is important in and of itself") or status.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zupr296Zy74wpihXT/use-your-identity-carefully">Use Your Identity Carefully</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  In Keep Your Identity Small, Paul Graham argues against associating yourself with labels (i.e. “libertarian,” “feminist,” “gamer,” “American”) because labels constrain what you’ll let yourself believe. ... Beliefs can constrain actions, but identity can also constrain actions directly. ... <b>Do you want to constrain your beliefs? No. ... Do you want to constrain your actions? Yes!</b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Identity is hard to change. Identity can be difficult to notice. Identity has unintended consequences. Use this tool only after careful deliberation. What would this identity do to your actions? What would it do to your beliefs? What social consequences would it have?
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR8c2NPp4bWHQ5u45/strategic-choice-of-identity">Strategic choice of identity</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  With identities, just like with habits, the easiest way to reduce or eliminate a bad one seems to be to install a new one that is incompatible with it.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  I've chosen X identities to adopt over the course of several months. Each identity has my definition, its benefits to me, and possible outcomes explicitly listed below.
</p>

<p>
  Some risks that extend to all:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Finding an excuse that allows me to violate an identity without social or personal repercussions and using it when convenient is a slippery slope because it allows me to maintain said identity yet continue to violate it. I trust myself to not "cheat" in this manner, but mental gymnastics is a powerful thing that I've definitely committed in the past.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abiding by some identities may conflict with each other due to time, energy, or other external constraints. There will have to be a balance found when situations like this occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Minor or major mental turmoil if I grossly violate an identity. The aforementioned mental gymnastics may help to explain some instances away, but others may be unexplainable and thus troubling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gatekeeping others when they threaten the validity of my identity. For example, if I consider myself well-read and knowledgable about a subject and meet someone who is visibly more well-read and knowledgable about the same subject, that throws into question just how much of an expert I was. I may try to question just how X someone is when I like to think I'm very much X.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking identities to the extreme may result in issues. A few examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trustworthy: I don't tell secrets despite me keeping it grossly harming others; I harm myself (not like that!) in trying to keep a commitment
      </li>
      <li>
        Open to Experiences: I say yes to things that are harmful
      </li>
      <li>
        Kind: I'm kind to people who don't deserve it
      </li>
    </ul>
    I trust that I can evaluate each situation and determine the right course of action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  And some thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I've come to find that status is important to me when writing down the benefits and outcomes of each identity. While not 100% of the purpose, I definitely want to be known as X and Y.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cultivation">Cultivation</h3>

<p>
  I cultivated these identities by focusing on the benefits of adopting them and the detriments of not adopting them, especially the social ramifications of the latter (e.g., what will people think of me if I'm an untrustworthy person?).
</p>

<p>
  Quite a few of these were already a part of me, but those that weren't only took a short while to do so.
</p>









<h3 id="generality">Generality</h3>

you want to choose general identities that apply to multiple things:

<p>
  I chose the top-down approach, or general identities that encompassed multiple behaviors. For example, being athletic requires consistent training, healthy eating, and ample sleep, among other, less impactful behaviors. By choosing to "be athletic" I'm choosing to adopt all of these behaviors instead of piecemealing everything through the individual parts.
</p>

<h3 id="list">List</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Trustworthy</button>

<div class="content">

<p>
  A trustworthy person does not tell others' information to non-privy parties and does what they say and practices what they preach, no matter the cost (within reason). No one has concerns using them as a confidant. Their word is solid and no one questions that they will get said task done. Any claims they make are not exaggerated and don't require a fact-check.
</p>

<h4>Benefits</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    I grow closer to people because they trust me with secrets
  </li>
  <li>
    I get assigned more important, high-profile tasks
  </li>
  <li>
    I become known as a trustworthy and dependable person
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    I will follow through on a large majority of commitments
  </li>
  <li>
    I will make fewer commitments, but the ones I do make are much more likely to be completed
  </li>
  <li>
    I get more work than others because of my dependability and their lack of it
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
  Success!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A majority of commitments I make resolve as true. I am judicious in the ones that resolve as false, taking care to ensure a) the others won't be significantly affected, and b) I have a valid reason.
  </li>
  <li>
    I consider my decisions more thoroughly now and instead of making fewer, I make them easier to succeed in (e.g., doing dinner 30 minutes later when I think I may be cutting it close)
  </li>
  <li>
    I've never told others' secrets when they explicitly tell me not to tell, so nothing has changed here
  </li>
  <li>
    I quantify or explain my claims to match my confidence (e.g., "I'm not entirely sure, but ...", "I'm very confident that ...")
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<p></p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Athletic</button>

  </li>
