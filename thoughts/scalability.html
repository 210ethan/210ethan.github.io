  Nothing is truly scalable in ever-increasing intensity <i>and</i> duration without being limited by something. Only one variable—intensity <i>or</i> duration, may be increased at any given time—the other must remain constant. A few examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Fitness: Both the body and mind require recovery between sessions. Consecutive sessions cannot be too intense. If the programming requires high volume, most of it is at lower intensities to help build a <a href="https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/what-is-base-training/">strong base</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Career: One can only go so far before being limited by intelligence, social factors, and/or luck.
