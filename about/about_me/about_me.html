<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>
  I attended <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> (TAMU) from August 2016 to May 2020, graduating with a bachelor's degree in <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html">electrical engineering</a>. My undergraduate thesis title was "Deep Reactive-Ion Etching Process Development and Mask Selection" and can be found <a href="https://github.com/ethanmorse/thesis/blob/master/ethan_morse_thesis.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
  I had three main responsibilities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Training and advising: New and existing users needed training and advising on lab procedures, processes, and tools. I demonstrated tools and helped them to achieve their desired result.

<h4 id="texas_instruments_internship">Internship (May 2019 - Aug 2019)</h4>

<p>
  I interned at Texas Instruments' D(allas)FAB in the summer of 2019 as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_implantation">ion implantation</a> manufacturing engineer. While there, I worked on three projects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Created an automated voltage monitoring system to predict tool alarms before they occurred, improving tool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_availability">operational availability</a> (A<sub>0</sub>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved ion implantation doses on a number of recipes to better match target values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modified tool hardware to prevent wire fraying, minimizing the risk of a faulty electrical signal being transmitted.
  </li>
</ul>
