<p>
  My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> scores (percentiles) using <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/">Open Psychometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">Truity</a>. Actual scores from each test are separated by the slash.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion">Extroversion</a>: 63/67. I am very comfortable around people I know or have something to talk about with, but do not enjoy big parties where I don't know very many people.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism">Neuroticism</a>: 57/29. I am known as a very happy and positive person amongst my friend group. I can get caught up on negative thinking loops, but it's rare.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness">Agreeableness</a>: 67/60. I am known as a very kind and empathetic person amongst my friend group. I sympathize with others' problems and emotions easily.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness">Conscientiousness</a>: 93/96. I am very exacting in a task, do not like procrastination, and enjoy working.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience">Openness to experience</a>: 40/69. I see myself as very intellectually curious (see my <a href="../../links.html">Links</a> page for the variety of subjects I read about), but am not incredibly open to new experiences, especially when the outcome is unknown or random. I do not view myself as very creative.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing_style">Writing Style</h2>

<p>
  I am making it a point to only write when I want to. No forcing myself, no saying just 15 minutes, no guilting. Myself and others have found that hobbies' fun factors tend to quickly fade once they become a "chore".
</p>

<p>
  I write about things that interest me (although there may be some parts within the subject that don't interest me).

<p>
  I own a <a href="https://www.bicyclebluebook.com/value-guide/product/14968/">2009 Cannondale Rize 4</a>, but generally ride my father's <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a20046399/first-look-the-turner-flux-v4-0/">Turner Flux</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I've built a few small wood features in the forest behind my parent's house (see below).

  A few of my favorite mountain biking media:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUeZMGrLAhY">Kranked 8 - Coastal Crew</a>: Easily my favorite video ever. The riders' styles, the way it's shot, the insane features (no one has ever done an X wall ride). The Coastal Crew now runs the <a href="https://www.coastgravitypark.ca/">Coast Gravity Park</a> in British Columbia.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xmZTLVhaRA">North Shore Extreme 8</a>: Showcases some of the craziest riding and riders on the Shore.
