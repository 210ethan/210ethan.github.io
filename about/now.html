<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  This page serves as a public archive of where and what I've been in past years. Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow</a> and two people who suggested I do this.
</p>

<p>
  These are written at the beginning of the year.

<h2 id="2024">2024</h2>

<p>
  I'm still invested in exercise. I will continue testing the minimum effective dose of riding that allows me to do well at ultraendurance cycling events. My strength progress is lackluster and I will attempt to improve this by all of my strength sessions being a minimum of 75-90 minutes. My interest in flexibility and balance has returned and my training and goals reflect that.
</p>

<p>
  I'm very likely to say yes to things if they are fun or allow for new experiences, even if they are costly. I am sensitive towards where my time goes and choose activities based on those that bring me the value I'm looking for (fun, new experiences, quality time, etc), and if not, outsource the time to someone else where reasonable.
</p>

<p>
  I'm much more interested in how organizations, especially startups and very large scale ones, start and continue to function.
</p>

<p>
  My goals for 2024 are as follows, with final results in parentheses (to be updated in December 2024):

<h2 id="2023">2023</h2>

<p>
  I'm still very interested and invested in exercise. I did well in a couple of XC marathon mountain bike races and plan to continue training hard and racing. I failed my second <a href="https://everesting.cc/">Everesting</a> attempt and will apply the lessons learned to the third. My number of training-related goals has decreased significantly after I learned for what must be the fourth time that having many goals is not conducive to achieving them. Focusing and aggressively pursuing a few is the key to accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
  My outlook on how important quality time is with friends and family has been further solidified after many fun, rewarding experiences with both friends and family. I hope to do a better job of maintaining friendships (although I already am pretty good at it) and spending quality time with others, even if it's just in the form of a phone call or quick lunch.
</p>

<p>
  Similar to the training goal epiphany above, I no longer stress about reading X books, learning Y skills, and so on.

<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>

<p>
  I'm very invested in training (exercising) for certain goals and spend many hours a week working towards them. My priorities are <a href="https://everesting.cc/">Everesting</a> on a mountain bike, 225 lb (100 kg) rear-foot-elevated split squat, pike straddle planche, and a solid OAC eccentric. The mental aspect of training is just as, if not more, important than the physical, and is a big theme in my practice and writing. <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/shop/p/poison-sermons-on-suffering">Poison: Sermons on Suffering</a> has been on my bedside table for thought-provoking late-night reading.
</p>

<p>
  I'm in the market for new experiences, especially after researching <a href="../research/slow.html">Slowing Time</a>, and try my best to avoid activities I've done before, unless they're with a friend or family member. Examples include meeting people, trying food/drink, travels, movies, shows, music, books, and activities in general.
</p>

<p>
  My focus in writing is two-fold: developing my thoughts on specific topics and learning more about questions/topics that interest me.
</p>

<h3 id="2022_review">2022 Review</h3>

<p>
  Training went well this year, especially in cycling, but I suffered from fuckarounditis on the strength front.
</p>

<p>
  I had a lot of new experiencesâ€”mostly in terms of restaurants and films.
