<p>
  This page serves as a public archive of where and what I've been in past years. Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow</a> and two people who suggested I do this.

<p>
  I'm very invested in training (exercising) for certain goals and spend many hours a week working towards them. My priorities are <a href="https://everesting.cc/">Everesting</a> on a mountain bike, 225 lb (100 kg) rear-foot-elevated split squat, pike straddle planche, and a solid OAC eccentric. The mental aspect of training is just as, if not more, important than the physical, and is a big theme in my practice and writing. <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/shop/p/poison-sermons-on-suffering">Poison: Sermons on Suffering</a> has been on my bedside table for thought-provoking late-night reading.
</p>

<p>
  I'm in the market for new experiences, especially after researching <a href="../research/slow.html">Slowing Time</a>, and try my best to avoid activities I've done before, unless they're with a friend or family member. Examples include meeting people, trying food/drink, travels, movies, shows, music, books, and activities in general.
</p>

<p>
  My focus in writing is two-fold: developing my thoughts on specific topics and learning more about questions/topics that interest me.
