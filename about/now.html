<p>
  This page serves as a public archive of where and what I've been in past years. Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow</a> and two people who suggested I do this.

<h2 id="2023">2023</h2>

<p>
  I'm still very interested and invested in exercise. I did well in a couple of XC marathon mountain bike races and plan to continue training hard and racing. I failed my second <a href="https://everesting.cc/">Everesting</a> attempt and will apply the lessons learned to the third. My number of training-related goals has decreased significantly after I learned for what must be the fourth time that having many goals is not conducive to achieving them. Focusing and aggressively pursuing a few is the key to accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
  My outlook on how important quality time is with friends and family has been further solidified after many fun, rewarding experiences with both friends and family. I hope to do a better job of maintaining friendships (although I already am pretty good at it) and spending quality time with others, even if it's just in the form of a phone call or quick lunch.
</p>

<p>
  Similar to the training goal epiphany above, I no longer stress about reading X books, learning Y skills, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  My goals for 2023 are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>

<p>
  I'm very invested in training (exercising) for certain goals and spend many hours a week working towards them. My priorities are <a href="https://everesting.cc/">Everesting</a> on a mountain bike, 225 lb (100 kg) rear-foot-elevated split squat, pike straddle planche, and a solid OAC eccentric. The mental aspect of training is just as, if not more, important than the physical, and is a big theme in my practice and writing. <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/shop/p/poison-sermons-on-suffering">Poison: Sermons on Suffering</a> has been on my bedside table for thought-provoking late-night reading.
</p>

<p>
  I'm in the market for new experiences, especially after researching <a href="../research/slow.html">Slowing Time</a>, and try my best to avoid activities I've done before, unless they're with a friend or family member. Examples include meeting people, trying food/drink, travels, movies, shows, music, books, and activities in general.
</p>

<p>
  My focus in writing is two-fold: developing my thoughts on specific topics and learning more about questions/topics that interest me.
</p>

<h3 id="2022_review">2022 Review</h3>

<p>
  Training went well this year, especially in cycling, but I suffered from fuckarounditis on the strength front.
</p>

<p>
  I had a lot of new experiencesâ€”mostly in terms of restaurants and films.
