<p>
  Should you sacrifice yourself if some weirdos come a'knocking?

<p>
  M. Night Shyamalan's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15679400/">Knock at the Cabin</a> tells the story of a family—two men and their adopted daughter—meeting a polite, yet insistent, group of strangers who come to the family's cabin claiming the world will end if they don't sacrifice one of themselves. The strangers know this because of a vision they all had at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  The following events happen after the strangers sacrifice one of their own to further delay the impending doom:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tsunamis
  </li>
  <li>
    Disease (in the form of the flu)
  </li>
  <li>
    Plane crashes
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The whole "you wouldn't do X if your friend told you to" spiel my parents would tell me when I was young was, and still is, bullshit. What if I replaced "your friend told you to" with "multiple highly improbable events occurred"? You bet your ass I'd follow the lemmings and expect you to do the same.
</p>

<p>
  This essay will help me decide if I should sacrifice myself if I'm ever in the position of that poor family.

<p>
  First, a short primer on Bayes' theorem. The <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq">Bayes' rule: Guide</a> is Yudkowsky-approved and a good summary with multiple difficulty levels. Bayes' theorem states that: 
</p>

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}\]

<p>
  where:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    \(P(A|B)\) is the probability of \(A\) given \(B\) is true, and vice versa for B given A
  </li>
  <li>
    \(P(A)\), \(P(B)\) is the probability of A and B
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In other words, if the ones of the right-hand probabilities change (priors), then the left-hand probability, \(P(A|B)\) or the posterior, should also change. This is referred to as updating.
</p>

<p>
  The question is: what is the probability of an apocalypse happening given tsunamis, disease, and plane crashes are occurring?
</p>

<p>
  This can be formulated as:
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(A | T, D, C) = P(T, D, C | A) &times; P(A) &divide; P(T, D, C)
</p>

<p>
  We can further break it up to individual probabilities:
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(A | T, D, C) = P(T | A) &times; P(D | A) &times; P(C | A) &times; P(A) &divide; (P(T) &times; P(D) &times; P(C))
</p>

<h3>Tsunamis: P(T | A) and P(T)</h3>

<p>
  What is the probability of massive tsunamis given an apocalyse is occurring?
</p>

<p>
  Probably pretty high. Remember, an apocalypse is "the complete final destruction of the world" or "an event involving destruction or damage on a catastrophic scale". 
</p>

<p>
  I'll assign P(T | A) a value of 0.6, or 60%:
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(T | A) = 0.6
</p>

<p>
  According to <a href="https://tsunami.gov/?page=tsunamiFAQ">U.S. Tsunami Warning Center</a>, damaging tsunamis occur about twice per decade. That's two in 3,650 days, a value of 0.00005, or 0.005% chance of a tsunami occurring on any given day.
</p>

<p>
  But we can further fine-tune this value given the information that an 8.6-magnitude earthquake, originating from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone">Cascadia Subduction Zone</a>, hit the Oregon coast. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100524121250.htm">Oregon State University concluded</a> there is "more than a one-in-three chance that [a >8.0-magnitude earthquake] will happen within the next 50 years". If we assume the probability is uniform across time, it becomes a 0.00002027, or 0.002027% chance, a massive tsunami happens on any given day.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the probability of either of these happening on a given day is 0.00007, or 0.007%:
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(T) = 0.00007
</p>

<h3>Disease: P(D | A) and P(D)</h3>

<p>
  What is the probability of a plague given an apocalyse is occurring?
</p>








<h3>Plane Crashes: P(C | A) and P(C)</h3>

<p>
  What is the probability of a many planes crashing given an apocalyse is occurring?
</p>

<p>
  Probably not as high for a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Loss of airplane electronics
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  I'll assign P(T | A) a value of 0.6, or 60%:
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(T | A) = 0.6
</p>




<p>
  The widely-cited figure of a plane crashing is 1 in 1.2 million, or 0.00000083, or 0.000083%. (LINK TO STUDY)
</p>

<p class="center">
  P(C) = 0.00000083
</p>
