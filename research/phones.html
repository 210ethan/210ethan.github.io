- how does probability change based on market share of iphones vs. noniphones?
  - eg if 75% of population is iphone, does my probability change to 75% vs 25%? how bad is my prediction if i guess iphone and get notiphone?

<p>
  Can you really tell if someone is an iPhone or non-iPhone user without actually seeing their phone?

  In my culture, there are certain types of people that don't use iPhones. Take that how you will, but don't get mad at me, I don't make the rules. And although there is definitely <i>some</i> confirmation bias going on, I don't think that's the entirety of it. I've been making predictions about which phone someone uses before I see it and I feel like I'm correct a majority of the time (again, confirmation bias absolutely plays a role here, but how much is up for debate and what I'm trying to accomplish here).
</p>

<p>
  This is my chance to actual record predictions. For every person that I know or meet but do not know their model of phone, I will predict the phone they use, find out which phone they use, then mark it down as a success or failure.
</p>

<p>
  A few ground rules for fair play:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If any specifics as pertaining to the model are said about their phone before I make my prediction, that prediction is no longer valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will not ask any probing questions about the phone itself. Personal questions that may help my prediction are allowed.
  </li>
  <li>
    People who I have texted before are off limits, whether or not I remember what type of phone they use.
  </li>
  <li>
    People who I know have immediate family members with certain phones are off limits, as I believe it more likely that if a son/daughter has an iPhone, the parents will, too. (I've found that the converse, inverse, and contrapositive are not necessarily true!)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The rules effectively boil down to me focusing on strangers or acquaintances whose personal history or details I know little to none of.
