<h2 id="intro_scope">Introduction and Scope</h2>

<p>
  This essay is meant to summarize the usefulness of six different foreign languages for native English speakers. The languages are: Arabic (MSA), Chinese Mandarin, French, German, Russian, and Spanish.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Arabic (MSA)
  </li>
  <li>
    Chinese Mandarin
  </li>
  <li>
    French
  </li>
  <li>
    German
  </li>
  <li>
    Russian
  </li>
  <li>
    Spanish
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Other languages will not be considered, as the number of speakers is relatively low, the job opportunities in those countries are low and sometimes undesirable, and only a few countries/regions speak the language.
</p>

<p>
  Usefulness will be quantified and qualified by the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Total number of speakers currently. Within this field, there will categories for first- and second- language speakers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total number of speakers in the future. For example, China's population is increasing quickly, thus the total number of Chinese speakers in the future will be larger than now.
  </li>
  <li>
    Geographic spread. How widely the language is spoken throughout the world. Languages that are spoken less frequently in more countries will be considered "better" than those that are spoken more frequently in fewer countries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Difficulty of acquisition for native English speakers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Current and Future Employment/Business Opportunities (GDP, etc)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Note that all of the above will be independent of personal reasons, such as heritage, cultural interest, etc. It will be based strictly on usefulness of what the language can get you monetarily, travel-wise, and connection-wise.
