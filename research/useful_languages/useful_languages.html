<h2 id="introduction_scope">Introduction and Scope</h2>

<p>
  This essay is meant to summarize the usefulness of six different foreign languages for native English speakers. The languages are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Arabic
  </li>
  <li>
    Chinese Mandarin
  </li>
  <li>
    French
  </li>
  <li>
    German
  </li>
  <li>
    Russian
  </li>
  <li>
    Spanish
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Other languages will not be considered, as the number of speakers is relatively low, the job opportunities in those countries are low, and only a few countries/regions speak the language.
</p>

<p>
  Usefulness will be quantified and qualified by the following. Note that all of the above will be independent of personal reasons, such as heritage, cultural interest, etc. It will be based strictly on usefulness of what the language can get you monetarily, travel-wise, and connection-wise.
</p>

<h3 id="speakers">Speakers</h3>

<p>
  The total number of both current and future speakers will be counted/estimated. Sources differ on the total number, so multiple will be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
  The future number of speakers will be of the year 2030 (10 years from when this essay was written).
</p>

<h3 id="geographic_spread">Geographic Spread</h3>

<p>
  How widely is the language spoken throughout the world? Mandarin is spoken throughout a large majority of China, but is also spoken in <a href="http://www.chinatownology.com/chinatowns_of_the_world.html">Chinatowns</a> throughout the world.
</p>

<p>
  Languages that are spoken less frequently in more countries will be considered better than those that are spoken more frequently in fewer countries.
</p>

<h3 id="difficulty_acquisition">Difficulty of Acquisition for English Speakers</h3>

<p>
  How difficult is it for a native English speaker to reach conversational levels of the target language? The more difficult, the less useful.

<h2 id="arabic">Arabic</h2>

<!--
<p>
  A note on Arabic dialects. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Arabic#Regional_varieties">many dialects</a> of Arabic stemming from different regions across north Africa and the Near East. In an attempt to unite them in one dialect so exchanges are understood by both parties, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)</a> was created. It is used as the standard in Arabic media, but is rarely spoken. Given that it can be understood by a majority of non-MSA Arabic speakers and it is recommended to learn MSA to establish a foundation for later dialect learning, all Arabic speakers will be counted, unless there are reports that a specific dialect cannot understand MSA.
