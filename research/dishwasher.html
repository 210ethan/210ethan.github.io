<p>
  My mom is an expert at efficiently loading dishwashers. I don't know if it's practice or natural talent, but she always finds a way to fit the last few dishes inside when it seems like there's no room left. And then there's me, the loader that justifies my poor loading skillz by just eating the cost of water and detergent.
</p>

<p>
  And there are certainly many more incompetent loaders just like me, wasting water, detergent, and, in some sense, time. How much of each is to be determined through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi estimate</a>.

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/hc/pdf/HC%203.1.pdf#page=6">U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey</a> outlines dishwasher usage:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <thead><tr><th>Usage</th><th>Number of housing units (millions)</th></thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Have a dishwasher</td><td>89.79</td></tr>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Used 0 times per week</td><td>17.11</td></tr>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Used 1 times per week</td><td>13.86</td></tr>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Used 2 to 3 times per week</td><td>26.32</td></tr>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Used 4 to 6 times per week</td><td>19.34</td></tr>
     <tr align="middle"><td>Used 7 or more times per week</td><td>13.17</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

[considerations: do you get better the more you use it? are those who use it minimally better, or they just have fewer dishes?]
