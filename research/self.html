<p>
  A place to keep track of tests (read: experiments) I run on myself. Methods are not necessarily rigorous, hence the use of "test", i.e., I am testing something on myself to see if how it works. Some tests deserve their own posts, but I will still link them below.

<h2 id="chewing">Chewing</h2>

<p>
  I am known as a fast eater among my friends and am generally the first to finish my meal. I seem to be perpetually hungry. I am rarely truly full after a meal, even if the servings are large. I notice my stomach feels poorly after eating meals, but I have not looked for a correlation for which meals. Finally, I don't spend too much time chewing my food.
</p>

<p>
  It appears that chewing more can help to solve my problems. Chewing more forces me to eat slower, allows my body to suppress hunger, and breaks the food down into easier-to-handle pieces for my digestive system.
</p>

<p>

<p>
  From 01-30 June 2021, I will chew each substantial bite until the food is essentially liquid in my mouth. I will report back on how full I feel throughout each day and how my digestive system feels after meals.
</p>

<h3 id="chewing_results">Results</h3>

<p>
  I found that I was more full after meals and my digestive system rarely had the same issues. I will continue to chew my food thoroughly.

<h2 id="waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</h2>

<p>
  While in university, I woke up consistently at 5:00am Monday through Saturday, regardless of my (pretty consistent) bedtime. There were slip-ups, of course, but rarely. Besides the circadian consistency, one factor I think played a role in the easiness of getting up was I had a reason to each day, and one that I was excited for. Be it exercise, <a href="../thoughts/aggiefab.html">work</a>, or doing some personal project, I always had something to work on in the morning. My phone turns to warm mode at least one hour before bed, and I don't use it much in bed.
</p>

<p>
  My life now is quite different. I don't enjoy work nearly as much, I prefer working on personal things in the evening, and my sleep schedule is a bit more wonky, but not by much:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    S: 7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    M: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    T: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    W: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    R: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    F: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    S: 6:00am
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of this leads to difficulty waking up in the morning, which I don't like. So, for this test I'll be waking up at the same time every morning for 21 days: 4:30am.
</p>

<p>
  This wake-up time will remain constant regardless of what time I go to bed or what I have to do in the morrow. I will attempt to keep both my bedtime and bedtime habits roughly constant. I generally read a non-fiction book for 15-30 min while lying down in bed with a warm-light lamp on. The room itself is 72-75 °F (22-24 °C), quite dark, and does not experience much sound besides muffled voices from my neighbors. I will have my last meal at least two hours before bed and be well-hydrated throughout the day. I will also include notes on exercise intensity and duration.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  This was much easier than expected. Yes, there were a couple of slip-ups in wake-up time (01 and 07 February 2021), but the 4:30am was relatively consistent. While I do not have a quantifiable baseline for how I felt before starting this, I felt surprisingly good throughout the 22 days, despite getting amounts of sleep I would balk at. My athletic performance did not seem to suffer. My days felt much longer—I now had an extra two hours in the morning to do whatever I wanted/needed. I could go in to work early and get out early, write, read, watch YouTube videos, etc.
</p>

  Log of waking up at the same time every day
</figcaption>
<img src="media/self/waking_up_same_time.png" alt="waking_up_same_time" class="center">

<p>
  A few lessons learned/reinforced:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Nine times out of ten I will feel fine after about 10:00 min of waking up, standing up, and being exposed to some type of white light. There was only one time where my grogginess lasted around two hours (it may have also been fueled by learning about purchase requisitions at work...).
  </li>
  <li>
    Waking up is much easier when there's a purpose for doing so. Waking up just to wake up can lead to rationalization and going back to sleep. My purposes included not wanting to botch this experiments, getting started on work tasks, and writing for this website. Sometimes I just ended up watching YouTube, though.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  I <strike>will</strike> will try to continue to consistently wake up at 4:30am in the future.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    18 February 2021: Much harder to wake up at 4:30am the past few days. Seems to be a few reasons. 1) It's very cold outside my bed (I'm in my childhood home and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9316,_2021_North_American_winter_storm">this storm</a> hit), as opposed to my apartment where everything is well-controlled. 2) I have lost momentum of getting up early. This has happened to me in the past, as well as in other aspects of my life.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>
  I recommend finding a wake-up time that works and sticking to it for 30 days. Keep track of bedtime and quality-of-life after waking up, then decide at the end if it's something worth continuing.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="trigger_action_plans">Trigger-Action Plans</h2>

<p>
  See my notes on trigger-action plans (TAP) <a href="../knowledge/notes.html#trigger_action_plans">here</a>. I will define each entry concisely with the goal, trigger, and action, then discuss the actual practice and results of each.
</p>

<p>
  I've also converted all of these into Anki cards in the form of reminders, affirmations, or reinforcers. For example, a card for <a href="#being_present">being present</a> features a recording of me laughing on one side and the words "Be present!" on the other—whenever I hear the laugh, I think of being present. All cards have a maximum review interval of 1 day, so they are reviewed every day. (This idea is discussed in Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/things/software/anki/">Instilling Novel Thought Patterns and Making Your Long-Term Memory Accountable with Anki</a>, which I highly recommend reading and implementing. More on it <a href="#novel_thought_patterns">below</a>.)
</p>

<h3 id="out_bed_faster">Getting Out of Bed Faster</h3>

<p>
  My normal wake-up routine involves my first alarm going off, me going back to bed for 5 min, then finally laying in bed for 15 min after the second alarm goes off. The big problem with this is that I've trained my body to become sleepy when I lie horizontally, so by remaining in bed I stay sleepy. After getting up and moving around for a few minutes, I'm completely awake and ready to go. This TAP will streamline the me-becoming-fully-awake process and give me back 20 min of my morning.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Get out of bed within 1:00 min of my alarm going off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: My natural sunlight alarm clock playing music and my iPhone alarm playing its sound.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Turn on my bedside lamp, remove my covers, and stand up.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I will practice this throughout my <a href="#waking_up_same_time">waking up at the same time every day test</a>.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
  This took about 5 times before it became an ingrained/natural behavior. Whenever I hear the alarm go off, I take the covers off, get out of bed, and start with my day. There were some days I only got 4:15 hr sleep (due to my <a href="#waking_up_same_time">waking up at the same time every day test</a>), but it was just as easy as the other days. Another thing that helps me is keeping up the habit: if I follow a habit and then stop, I tend to rationalize with myself that I don't have to start up again. If I were to lapse in the one-minute rule one day, it would be significantly harder to pick it back up again. See the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/">X effect</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Some suggestions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Having a warm room (72-75 °F, 22-24 °C) helps immensely. A cold room and warm bed make the bed even more inviting, while a warm room and warm bed make it "meh" and sometimes even uncomfortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make your wake-up alarm a distinct sound from any other alarms you set. This may increase the strength of the trigger.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="being_present">Being Present</h3>

<p>
  The past couple of weeks I have been trying to truly enjoy individual moments: driving to work listening to music, riding my Airdyne in my apartment, walking in the nearby park. In doing so, I've found that I get much greater enjoyment and happiness out of focusing on how nice that moment is. However, sometimes it's difficult to remember to focus on this, hence my using a TAP.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Gain greater enjoyment out of the enjoyable moments I am in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Original: Me laughing (enjoying myself). (This failed.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Revision 1: Seeing the freckle on my left hand.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Recognize how enjoyable the current moment is.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I use Anki to help reinforce this. The front of the card says "Be present!" and the back of the card is an audio recording of me laughing.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    13 Feb 2021: This has not worked as well as I expected it to. I review every day and listen to the audio, but do not find myself associating laughter with "Be present!". I will start to try to "feel" happiness and enjoyment when I review this card.
  </li>
  <li>
    13 March 2021: I am marking this experiment as failed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="novel_thought_patterns">Novel Thought Patterns</h3>

<p>
  This idea is taken from and discussed in greater detail in Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/things/software/anki/">Instilling Novel Thought Patterns and Making Your Long-Term Memory Accountable with Anki</a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: "have a certain thought you want to be having or an action you want to be doing".
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Visual (via Anki text and image) reminder of the thought/action.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Think the thought or perform the action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below is a running list of the novel thoughts I am instilling. F: [text] | B: [text/picture] means the front and back of an Anki card. I try to make the text short and easy to remember and the picture of something I regularly see.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    F: &#60;3 minutes // B: If it takes less than 3 minutes, just do it! [Picture of trash can.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: Eat the frog! // B: Choosing the hardest task first makes the following ones easy. [Picture of a to-do list box checked off.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: Do I really want sugar? // B: No. This feeling will soon pass. [Picture of donuts, my favorite type of sugary food.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: My <a href="../thoughts/regret.html#major_regrets">major regrets in life</a> // B: The lessons I learned from each regret.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
  These installations worked. As relevant situations come up, I often think these thoughts and act accordingly.
</p>

<h3 id="small_taps">Small TAPs</h3>

<p>
  A few insignificant TAPs I use:
</p>

<ul>

    Goal: Place my work badge in the same spot when getting home.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Walking through the front door and taking off my backpack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Place my badge in my backpack.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Lock the door after getting home.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Walking through the front door.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Locking the door.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Stopping lightheadedness after standing up too quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Lightheadedness after standing up too quickly.
  </li>

  <li>
    Goal: Remember if I locked the door or not.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Locking my apartment door when leaving.

<h2 id="nonprophet">Revival: a nonprophet Symposium</h2>

<p>
  In March 2021, <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/">nonprophet</a> posted an offering of a free symposium:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    For the first time, we are offering a nonprophet symposium for purchase by effort. This is a “put your merit where your mouth is” offer. In order to foster the kind of experience that we find valuable, we are asking that attendees prepare in a way that strongly influences the power of change. It is attention, and it is intention. It is removing that which pacifies, numbs, and blocks the senses. To revive oneself, one must attune and make the body sensitive to its current state. The requirements are simple, we ask for participants to abide by “three diets”:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Consumption Diet 1</b> — Media and Entertainment. What we hear, see, and believe influences how we think and behave. The first diet is to understand how the information we surround ourselves with affects us. We ask that two weeks before the symposium (starting April 9th) that you remove all mass entertainment. Streaming video, news cycles, and social media fall into this category. The goal here is not to tell you what to remove but to give you space and permission in which to decide what you should remove. The goal is to remove influence, to generate your own thoughts about the world that you live in, to become sensitive to your input and better at the output. This time is used to cultivate and understand conversations and relationships that make up your worldview—by removing them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Consumption Diet 2</b> — Nourishment. Anything that does not nourish and restore the body (food and drink) should be forgone for two-weeks before the symposium. We will not tell you what to eat — that is presumptuous — and your job to decipher. Our advice is to take your mind — and its potential to seek pleasure over provision — out of the equation as best you can. Ask yourself what your body would request if it were doing its best to keep you alive and function well. Sensitize yourself to the simplicity of nutrient-dense foods that help you recover from training. Minimize salty, spicy, and sweet foods. These are usually condiments to pleasure-seeking and only helpful to nourishment when applied consciously.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Consumption Diet 3</b> — Substances. We all use substances in different ways. Coffee to mask our limited sleep, cannabis to mask our restlessness, our cutting criticism of others to mask our inability to change ourselves, and alcohol to mend everything in between. We ask that one week before the symposium (April 16th) you do your best to understand your relationship with substances by removing their habitual use.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  While I wasn't able to attend, I figured it would be an interesting experience to at least follow their three consumption diets on the same timeline as the participants, so I did.
</p>

<h3 id="diet_1">Consumption Diet 1 - Media and Entertainment (9-23 April 2021)</h3>



<h3 id="diet_2">Consumption Diet 2 - Nourishment (9-23 April 2021)</h3>

<h2 id="melatonin">Melatonin</h2>

<p>
  There are only so many hours in the day, and I'd rather spend as many of those as possible awake and active, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping">sleeping in</a>. The problem then becomes how to maximize sleep quality while minimizing sleep time.
</p>

<p>
  I practice the following sleep hygiene recommendations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sleep in a cool, dark room. I have blackout curtains that block a majority of window light.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eliminate blue light within two hours of bedtime. I set warm light on all electronics and have red lights installed in my living room and bedroom.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not eat within two hours of bedtime. This varies, but I rarely violate it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to bed and wake up at the same time (or as close to) every day. This varies. See <a href="#waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Associate the bed with only sleep and sex. I don't do anything else in my bed or go in my room.
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to bed happy and without any life issues (a clear conscience is the softest pillow). I journal every night before bed and rarely experience anxiety, sadness, or anger.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Since I've satisfied all of these, more help can be found from supplements. (The average person can easily say screw it and jump straight to this step, but I don't think it will be able to overcome poor sleep hygiene. Results may vary.)
</p>

<p>
  There are quite a few melatonin resources out there:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin">Melatonin</a>, Gwern
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/">Summary of Melatonin</a>, Kamal Patel (for Examine.com)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Experimentation will be simple: 30 days of regular sleep patterns as described above plus <a href="https://www.heb.com/product-detail/h-e-b-melatonin-3-mg-tablets/1003469">0.3 mg melatonin</a> an hour before I expect to go to bed. I will not make major attempts to stay strict, e.g., I will stay out past my regular bedtime with friends if the situation arises.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  I will track the same metrics as I did in <a href="#waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Bedtime/wake-up time to 15:00 min resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ease of waking. Was I immediately awake or groggy?
  </li>
  <li>
    How well-rested I feel during the first period after waking up.
  </li>
  <li>
    How long I read for in bed.
  </li>
  <li>
    What I did for exercise that day in terms of type, volume, and intensity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Last meal time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hydration throughout the day.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I expect I will feel more well-rested upon waking.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  I ended up not doing this experiment. I may return to it in the future.
