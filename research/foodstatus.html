Blind Tasting Test:
Have participants blind-taste food from high-status and low-status restaurants without knowing the source.
Ask them to rate the food on taste, presentation, and overall satisfaction.


Price Information Manipulation:
Serve the same dish to two groups: one group is told it’s from a high-end restaurant, and the other is told it’s from a low-cost eatery.
Compare their ratings to see if perceived price influences their evaluation.


Atmosphere Influence Study:
Serve identical meals in two different settings: one with upscale ambiance and one with a casual, low-key atmosphere.
Have participants rate their dining experience, focusing on how atmosphere affects their perception of the food.


Social Media Hype Experiment:
Present food from the same restaurant to two groups but provide one group with rave reviews and social media hype about the place.
Measure the difference in their ratings and overall satisfaction.


Longitudinal Study:
Over several weeks, have participants visit a mix of high-status and low-status restaurants without prior knowledge of the places.
Track their ratings and preferences over time to see if initial perceptions change with repeated exposure.


Value Comparison:
Compare participants’ ratings of meals from high-status and low-status restaurants in terms of value for money.
Analyze if higher prices correlate with higher perceived value despite actual taste and satisfaction levels.
