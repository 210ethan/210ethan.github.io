<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://niplav.site/index.html">niplav</a> and I were discussing what makes good living room decor. It must be thought-provoking and not distracting. Movement is nice, but too much or too quickly violates the distraction rule. The idea of an aquarium or terrarium was brought up. niplav then came up with the idea of a conversation visualizer (CV): create an image based on the last few minutes of conversation and display it for all to see.

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>
  The CV consists of three parts that build off of each other:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Voice: Record a conversation
  </li>
  <li>
    Text: Transcribe the audio recording and summarize
  </li>
  <li>
    Image: Create an image based on the transcription
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Throw this in a simple while loop that continues to go so long as there aren't any errors and power is maintained.
</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>
  I used OpenAI and its API to keep everything in the same ecosystem: Whisper for transcription, GPT for summarization, and DALLÂ·E for image generation.

<p>
  Here are the not-quite-foolproof-because-if-you're-reading-this-you-probably-have-some-technological-ability instructions to get the software working:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download Python3, all packages used in visualization.py, and visualization.py
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an OpenAI account
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python">Developer quickstart guide</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow microphone and accessibility access to the program that will run visualization.py
  </li>
</ol>
