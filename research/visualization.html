<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://niplav.site/index.html">niplav</a> and I were discussing what makes good living room decor. It must be thought-provoking and not distracting. Movement is nice, but too much or too quickly violates the distraction rule. The idea of an aquarium or terrarium was brought up. niplav then came up with the idea of a conversation visualizer (CV): create an image based on the last few minutes of conversation and display it for all to see.

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>
  The CV consists of three parts that build off of each other:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Voice: Record a conversation
  </li>
  <li>
    Text: Transcribe the audio recording and summarize
  </li>
  <li>
    Image: Create an image based on the transcription
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Throw this in a simple while loop that continues to go so long as there aren't any errors and power is maintained.
</p>

<figcaption>
  The conversation starts with [name] discussing a poker tournament he is hosting on Friday with some friends. The other person asks if the friends playing poker are also from church, to which [name] replies that he is not sure. The conversation then takes a random turn as they start discussing the taste and smell of broccoli. They talk about how the broccoli shrinks when microwaved due to the starches and expansion of frozen water. The person suggests that if you microwaved a cup of ice, it would become more full, while [name] disagrees and says it would be less full.

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>
  I used OpenAI and its API to keep everything in the same ecosystem: Whisper for transcription, GPT for summarization, and DALLÂ·E for image generation.

<p>
  Here are the not-quite-foolproof-because-if-you're-reading-this-you-probably-have-some-technological-ability instructions to get the software working:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download Python3, all packages used in visualization.py, and visualization.py
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an OpenAI account
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python">Developer quickstart guide</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow microphone and accessibility access to the program that will run visualization.py
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

  Hardware is user-dependent and offers a few options:

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
  The first full run through of the record-transcribe-summarize-visualize logic was after watching Pearl Jam's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDaOgu2CQtI">Do the Evolution</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Transcription was:
</p>

<blockquote>
  So it seems like everything leads to war there was the nuclear bomb going off in the end the people marching Planes dropping bombs things like that. I Like the first part of Starting with fish to dinosaurs to cavemen. It also seemed like a progressive rise in Like power it starts with the fish and then it ends up politicians are kind of at the end along with military power It seems like it progresses like that all throughout It's basically it starts with war and it ends with war and the whole time It's just power is escalating and It's it probably the message is that
</blockquote>

<p>
  Summary was:
</p>

<blockquote>
  the conversation discusses how everything seems to lead to war, with references to nuclear bombs, marching people, and planes dropping bombs. The first part of the conversation mentions the progression from fish to dinosaurs to cavemen, highlighting a rise in power. It is noted that politicians and military power are at the forefront towards the end. The conversation concludes that there is a continuous escalation of power and suggests that the message may be that war is inevitable throughout history.
