<p>
  <a href="http://niplav.site/index.html">niplav</a> and I were discussing what makes good living room decor. It must be thought-provoking and not distracting. Movement is nice, but too much or too quickly violates the distraction rule. The idea of an aquarium or terrarium was brought up. niplav then came up with the idea of a conversation visualizer (CV): create an image based on the last few minutes of conversation and display it for all to see.

<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>
  The CV consists of three parts that build off of each other:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Voice: Record X minutes of conversation
  </li>
  <li>
    Text: Transcribe the voice recording into text, then summarize
  </li>
  <li>
    Image: Create an image based on the transcription
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>
  I used OpenAI to keep everything in the same ecosystem: Whisper for transcription, GPT for summarization, and DALLÂ·E for image generation.
</p>

[include individual steps on how to get this set up]

<p>
  My code was pretty straightforward (<a href="media/visualization/visualization.py">.py file link</a>):
