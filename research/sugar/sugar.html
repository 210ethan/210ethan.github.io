<h1 id="sugar">Cutting Sugar</h1>

<p>
  Like most people, I enjoy sugary foods. But if I could never crave sugary food again, I'd be happy: it's much healthier and I can get similar satisfaction elsewhere. Here I abstain from self-proclaimed sugary foods (>10 g added sugar) for 31 days (01 January 2021 - 31 January 2021) and subjectively measure the intensity of sugar cravings.

<p>
  Unhealthy eating can be viewed as a habit.

<p>
  Below I list all foods I ate that are over 10 g and note down any cravings for the day.  Listed in parentheses next to the food is total approximate amount of sugar consumed in grams, e.g., "overnight oats (27 g)". Each number corresponds to the day in January 2021, e.g., 3 is 03 January 2021.

<ol>
  <li>
    Food: N/A. No sugar cravings. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 and 5 g.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Small amount of honey. No sugar cravings. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 and 5 g.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Small amount of honey. One instance of a sugar craving, but small. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 g for each. I've found that eating sweet-flavored foods helps satiate the sweet tooth, even if the food has little sugar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: 18 g of sugar from three Chick-fil-A sandwiches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: No large amount of sugar, but the overnight oats I had were a bit sweet. Had a few cravings while looking at <a href="https://projectmythology.blogspot.com/2008/12/refeed-day.html">Myth's refeed days</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Sweet, but not too sugary, overnight oats for breakfast. No sugar cravings otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Overnight oats again + oatmeal in evening with honey. Finding that eating something sweet (e.g., vanilla yogurt with 6 g sugar per 3/4 cup) satisfies my sweet cravings.
