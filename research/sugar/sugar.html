<h1 id="sugar">Cutting Sugar</h1>

<p>
  Like most people, I enjoy sugary foods. But if I could never crave sugary food again, I'd be happy: it's much healthier and I can get similar satisfaction elsewhere. Here I abstain from self-proclaimed sugary foods (>10 g added sugar per serving) for 31 days (01 January 2021 - 31 January 2021) and subjectively measure the intensity of sugar cravings and how I felt.

  Unhealthy eating can be viewed as a habit.

  Below is a collection of online anecdotes by people who cut sugar out of their diet.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    My husband and I went sugarless for 21 days years back. Including cutting out refined starches. We had intense headaches that started on the third day if I remember correctly. Mine lasted 2 days, him 4. That was the only downside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pros were huge. Best of the best was that everything tasted great. All fruit were super sweet and dessert like. Vegetables had a depth of flavor I never noticed before. Even grains like oats and rice were yummy. We lost a few pounds to boot, though that wasn't our intention. My skin improved. So did my sleep.

<blockquote>
  I found I overall felt so much better when I stopped eating foods with added sugar. Skin cleared up and much more energy. You will have withdrawal headaches for a couple of days, but otherwise you will feel better.

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    For the first three days, I was indeed lacking in energy and felt pretty tired, but I didn't by any means feel awful. After those three days I felt amazing; I had tonnes of energy, I fell asleep instantly when I went to bed and woke up feeling energetic, clear and alert.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only do I wake up feeling great, but this greatness lasts all throughout the day with barely any dips. Before I quit sugar I would usually take a nap in the middle of the day and after I ate my first meal at 12 I would be incredibly tired. Now, although I do have a dip in energy after I've eaten, it's not by much and I still feel like I can power through the things I have to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extra energy made me feel much stronger on all my exercises and to make things even better my pull ups, dips, tucked front levers and tucked planche which had seriously been plateauing, suddenly went on the rise again. This is despite the fact that I'm in a calorific deficit.

    noticing improved energy levels and generally feeling like a better human being throughout the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    after being off the sugar for 26 of 30 days (I got-got traveling to a foreign country), I couldn't believe how sensitive I became to it.

  Below I list all foods I ate that could be considered sugary or sweet and how I felt that day. Each number corresponds to the day in January 2021, e.g., 3 is 03 January 2021.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Food: N/A. No sugar cravings. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 and 5 g.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Small amount of honey. No sugar cravings. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 and 5 g.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Small amount of honey. One instance of a sugar craving, but small. Had two energy bars that were chocolate-flavored, but the added sugar was only 4 g for each. I've found that eating sweet-flavored foods helps satiate the sweet tooth, even if the food has little sugar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: 18 g of sugar from three Chick-fil-A sandwiches. No cravings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: No large amount of sugar, but the overnight oats I had were a bit sweet. Had a few cravings while looking at <a href="https://projectmythology.blogspot.com/2008/12/refeed-day.html">Myth's refeed days</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Sweet, but not too sugary, overnight oats for breakfast. No sugar cravings otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Overnight oats again + oatmeal in evening with honey. Finding that eating something sweet (e.g., vanilla yogurt with 6 g sugar per 3/4 cup) satisfies my sweet cravings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Honey on oatmeal (about 10 g sugar). No cravings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Overnight oats. No cravings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Remaining overnight oats. Body feels lethargic and I have a slight headache. This could be the withdrawals some have talked about. Will see how I feel in the coming days.
  </li>
  <li>
    Food: Two bowls of oatmeal with honey drizzled on top. Body feels much better today.
