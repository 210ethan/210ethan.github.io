<h1 id="signs">Stealing Political Signs: Helpful or Harmful to Your Cause?</h1>

  I occasionally see news clips or YouTube videos of people stealing or attempting to steal political signs. Heck, it even happened in a neighborhood near mine. A common comment about these antics is that it doesn't actually help the thief's cause, but hurts it: the sign owner will be angry their sign is stolen and purchase a new one, donating to the campaign the thief dislikes.

  This essay will examine benefits from both perspectives: how impactful is the money the sign brings in and how impactful is the advertising the sign brings in? If the advertising is more impactful than the money, stealing political signs helps the thief's cause. If the money is more impactful than the advertising, the thief should leave the sign alone.

  This is not an endorsement of sign-stealing nor encouraging signs to be stolen.

  First, how much are typical signs? Trump sells a <a href="https://shop.donaldjtrump.com/products/official-trump-pence-2020-yard-sign-white-set-of-2">set of 2</a> for $20, while Biden sells a <a href="https://store.joebiden.com/biden-harris-yard-sign/">single sign</a> for $25. Assuming both of Trump's signs get stolen during one theft, they can be viewed as a single sign. The average then comes to $22.50, and rounding up returns $25/sign.
</p>

<p>
  So how much benefit does $25 do? The answer is likely zero. Trump's 2016 campaign raised <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate?id=n00023864">$433 MM</a>, while Clinton's campaign raised <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate?id=n00000019">$770 MM</a>. $25 is a mere 0.000005774% and 0.000003247% of both funds.
