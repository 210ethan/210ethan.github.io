<h1 id="face">Strange-Face Illusion</h1>

<p>
  In December 2020, I read the Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/locking-eyes-with-a-monster/">Locking Eyes with a Monster</a>, describing Giovanni Caputo's research. As the article's authors put it:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Throughout their close encounter, each member of the duo experienced their partner’s face as everchanging. Human features became animal traits, transmogrifying into grotesqueries. There were eyeless faces, and faces with too many eyes. The semblances of dead relatives materialized. Monstrosities abounded.
</blockquote>

<p>
  First, I discuss the literature behind the strange-face illusion (SFI), then report on my experiments.
</p>

<p>
  Caputo's original article is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46280355_Strange-face-in-the-mirror_illusion">Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Caputo's method was simple. Use a lamp with dim lighting, stick the subject in front of a mirror, and have them look at themselves for 10 minutes.
</p>

<blockquote>
  These observations were made in a quiet room dimly lit by a 25 W incandescent light. The lamp was placed on the floor behind the observer so that it was not visible either directly or in the mirror. A relatively large mirror (0.5 m &#215; 0.5 m) was placed about 0.4 m in front of the observer. Luminance of the reflected face image within the mirror was about 0.2 cd m<sup>-2</sup> and this level allowed detailed perception of fine face traits but attenuated colour perception. The illusion occurred even at higher levels of illumination of observer's face (0.2 to 1.6 cd m<sup>-2</sup>) The task of the observer was to gaze at his/her reflected face within the mirror.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The onset of strange-face illusion was quite fast:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Usually, after less than a minute, the observer began to perceive the strange-face illusion.
</blockquote>

<p>
  And with perplexing results:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The descriptions differed greatly across individuals and included: (a) huge deformations of one's own face (reported by 66% of the fifty participants); (b) a parent's face with traits changed (18%), of whom 8% were still alive and 10% were deceased; (c) an unknown person (28%); (d) an archetypal face, such as that of an old woman, a child, or a portait of an ancestor (28%); (e) an animal face such as that of a cat, pig, or lion (18%); (f) fantastical and monstrous beings (48%).
</blockquote>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  So as not to prime the participants into describing anything like in Caputo's original study, I instructed them as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Stare at your face in a mirror continuously for 10:00 minutes in dim lighting conditions that still allow for the distinguishing of facial features. Move and blink as little as possible. Eliminate visual and audible distractions before starting.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I mentioned nothing about SFI or what they might expect to see. For their report, I asked them to write a short paragraph about what they experienced at roughly what times (beginning, middle, end). If the participant had heard of SFI, I merely noted it down, as prior knowledge doesn't seem to have any effect on whether the SFI occurs.

  <a href="https://www.gwern.net">Gwern</a> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/bo4tts/the_strange_face_illusion_locking_eyes_with_a/">posted about this</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex">r/slatestarcodex</a>, commenting on his experience:
</p>

<blockquote>
  When I tried it now, I didn't get much of an effect. After 10 minutes of very rigidly staring into a mirror at an eye or between my eyebrows as a target ((blinking or saccading at all seems to reset it), the most I get is the usual visual illusion effect of saturation leading to fade out and then a flesh-colored blur obscuring my face. I guess the people who see monsters go beyond a blur and are able to fill it in with something more interesting?
