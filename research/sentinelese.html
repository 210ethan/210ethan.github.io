<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese">Sentinelese</a> inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean. Despite having been contacted by a handful of outsiders, they are effectively isolated from the modern world, guarded by the Indian navy and a hefty distrust of non-Sentinelese people. A majority of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese#History_of_contacts">individuals who have landed on the island</a> have been met with hostility in the form of bows and arrows.
</p>

<p>
  This prompts the obvious question: how would one go about trying to exterminate every last Sentinelese on the island?
