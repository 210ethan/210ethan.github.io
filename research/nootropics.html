<h3>Design</h3>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p>
  I followed niplav's <a href="http://niplav.site/nootropics.html#Caffeine">caffeine experiment design</a>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Fill <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6KT8LC">empty capsules</a> with 200 mg PE1 (treatment) and flour (placebo), wiping down each afterwards lest some PE1 residue or flour be on the capsule's exterior
  </li>
  <li>
    Write "1" or "2" on slips of paper, where 1 is PE1 and 2 is placebo (in hindsight I should have set 0 = placebo and 1 = PE1, but whatevs)
  </li>
  <li>
    Place a capsule with the appropriate slip of paper into an unlabeled envelope
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoroughly mix the envelopes with eyes closed
  </li>
  <li>
    Number the envelopes 1 to n
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoroughly mix the now-numbered envelopes with eyes closed
  </li>
  <li>
    Open one envelope each morning, take its contents carefully (see Confounders section below), and mark down the envelope number for that day
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Confounders</h4>

<p>
  Some possible shortcomings and how I addressed them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Weight: The PE1 pill appears to weight slightly more than the placebo pill. This is marginal and only noticeable when I have one in either hand. I do not expect to notice a difference when consuming them on their own.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rattling: The PE1 rattles slightly in its capsule when moved quickly, causing me to immediately know what I am taking if I feel or hear rattling. To minimize this risk, I will put water in my mouth before putting the capsule in. Headphones will be playing loud music to prevent hearing the rattling. If I still notice rattling, I will update this section with my new plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taste: I cannot wash the capsules off because they dissolve in liquid. I had to resort to thoroughly wiping them off with a paper towel. I will take each capsule with a healthy dose of water to dilute any taste on the capsule's exterior and attempt to avoid my tongue touching it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sight: The envelopes I used are slightly transparent, allowing me to see the outline of the capsule and slip of paper (which I wrote on very faintly in pencil). Regardless, I do not look at the envelope at all until the end of the day and after I make my prediction. The slip of paper is kept secret until the final day
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Metrics</h4>

<p>
  I kept track of the following metrics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sleep: Bedtime; awake time; sleepiness at bedtime; sleepiness at awake time
  </li>
  <li>
    Productivity: General productivity score based on items accomplished; ability to focus; how "sharp" I am
  </li>
  <li>
    Exercise: Session intensity; session duration; session quality
  </li>
  <li>
    Mood: Irritability; excitement
  </li>
</ul>
