<h1 id="cold">Cold Tolerance</h1>

<p>
  First, a quote (that I can't find, so I'll have to paraphrase) replying to a user asking about preparing for cold water torture at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BUD/S">BUD/S</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Preparing for cold water torture is like preparing to get kicked in the balls. There's no preparing for it and it sucks every time.
</blockquote>

<p>
  While he's half right—it does suck every time—I refuse to believe there's no preparing for it. Preparation is not exclusively acclimatization to cold. It can also be in the form of management techniques.
