<h1 id="cold">Cold Tolerance</h1>

<p>
  First, a quote (that I can't find, so I'll have to paraphrase) replying to a user asking about preparing for cold water torture at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BUD/S">BUD/S</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Preparing for cold water torture is like preparing to get kicked in the balls. There's no preparing for it and it sucks every time.
</blockquote>

<p>
  While the quote is half-right—it does suck every time—I refuse to believe there's no preparing for it. Preparation is not exclusively acclimatization to cold. It can also be in the form of management techniques.
