<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I was (am?) notorious amongst my friends and family for having poor battery life. One friend and I had a running joke that whenever I met up with him, my phone was at less than 20% battery. While it may be availability bias, it probably happened more often than not.
</p>

<p>
  But is this truly my fault (probably)? Do I use my phone too much (probably)? Or is my low phone battery a product of certain conditions that drain my battery faster than normal? In an attempt to exonerate myself, I ran the following experiments:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Baseline
  </li>
  <li>
    Volume at 4, 8, 12, and 16 notches
  </li>
  <li>
    Brightness at minimum, half, and maximum
  </li>
  <li>
    Flashlight
  </li>
  <li>
    Open apps in the background
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  All experiments were done with the following phone:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Model Name: iPhone 13 mini
  </li>
  <li>
    iOS Version: 16.6
  </li>
  <li>
    Model Number: MLAF3LL/A
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The phone was charged to 100%, left plugged in for five minutes more, then unplugged and the experiment immediately started.
</p>

<p>
  The house's thermostat was set to 74 Â°F for all testing. While I performed this in a bedroom, the phone was not in any direct sunlight (undesired heating) nor in front of an AC vent's line of flow (undesired cooling). To accommodate for the volume test and not disturbing others in the house, the phone was wrapped in a blanket for all tests.
</p>

<h3 id="baseline">Baseline</h3>

<p>
  Baseline conditions were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Brightness at minimum
  </li>
  <li>
    No open apps
  </li>
  <li>
    Wi-Fi on
  </li>
  <li>
    Bluetooth on
  </li>
</ul>




<h3 id="volume">Volume</h3>

<p>
  Volume conditions were identical to baseline conditions, but the Apple Music app was open and the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2TcNkNBtQ">Young Man Blues by Modern Life is War</a> set on repeat.
</p>





<h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>

<p>
  Volume conditions were identical to baseline conditions, but the brightness was set to 50% (approximately) and 100%.
</p>







<h3 id="flashlight">Flashlight</h3>

<p>
  Flashlight conditions were identical to baseline conditions, but the flashlight was turned on.
</p>









<h3 id="apps">Background Apps</h3>

<p>
  Background apps conditions were identical to baseline conditions, but the following apps were open: Messages, Gmail, Chrome, Apple Music, and Discord.
</p>
