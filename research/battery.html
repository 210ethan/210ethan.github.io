<p>
  I was (am?) notorious amongst my friends and family for having poor battery life. One friend and I had a running joke that whenever I met up with him, my phone was at less than 20% battery. While it may be availability bias, it probably happened more often than not.
</p>

<p>
  But is this truly my fault (probably)? Do I use my phone too much (probably)? Or is my low phone battery a product of certain conditions that drain my battery faster than normal? In an attempt to exonerate myself, I ran the following experiments:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Baseline battery test
  </li>
  <li>
    Volume
  </li>
  <li>
    Brightness
  </li>
  <li>
    Open apps in the background
  </li>
  <li>
    Flashlight
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  All experiments were done with the following (taken from the Settings/General/About screen):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Software version: 15.6.1
  </li>
  <li>
    Model Name: iPhone SE
  </li>
  <li>
    Model Number: A2275
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The phone was charged to 100%, left plugged in for five minutes more, then unplugged and the experiment started.
</p>

<p>
  Ambient temperature was 66 Â°F.
