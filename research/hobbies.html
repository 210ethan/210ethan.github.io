<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>
  First, the term "hobby" must be generally defined, followed by examples of what a hobby is and isn't.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hobby">Merriam-Webster</a>:
    <blockquote>
      a pursuit outside one's regular occupation engaged in especially for relaxation
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hobby">Dictionary.com</a>:
    <blockquote>
      an activity or interest pursued for pleasure or relaxation and not as a main occupation
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby">Wikipedia</a>:
    <blockquote>
      A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time.
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are all okay and similar, but not perfect, at least how I would choose to define hobby. For example, hanging out with friends is an activity I enjoy that's outside of my job, but is that really a hobby? Dictionary.com's definition is probably the closest to my own, so I'll plagiarize and simplify to:
</p>

<blockquote>
  an activity pursued for pleasure
</blockquote>

<p>
  This definition gives two important characteristics of a hobby:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goals: There is some type of goal associated with the hobby (indicated by the use of "pursued"), whether improvement, an end product, or competition
  </li>
  <li>
    Enjoyment: The hobbyist derives some amount of satisfaction out of the hobby (indicated by the use of "pleasure"), whether it be from the process or result
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some examples should be given, where the "yes" category is taken from Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies">list of hobbies</a> and the "no" category taken from my mind. There is some overlap between the two, which depends on the hobbyist's purpose.
</p>

<p>
  Legitimate hobbies include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    3-D printing: The hobbyist improves at designing products while also getting a final product that may be useful to them
  </li>
  <li>
    Candle making: The hobbyist improves the quality of their candle and gets a candle out of it
  </li>
  <li>
    Language learning: The hobbyist improves their language skill and can use it in real world situations
  </li>
  <li>
    Mountain biking: The hobbyist improves their bike handling ability and fitness
  </li>
  <li>
    Pottery: The hobbyist
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Illegitimate hobbies include:
