<h1 id="problems">Problems with Modern Science</h1>

<p>
  This post examines the problems with modern-day science and academia as a whole.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="predatory_publishing">Predatory Publishing</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing">Predatory publishing</a> is:
</p>

<blockquote>
  an exploitive academic publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without checking articles for quality and legitimacy and without providing the other editorial and publishing services that legitimate academic journals provide, whether open access or not
</blockquote>

<p>
  In plain English, any Joe Schmoe can submit his revelatory paper that sets a new high score on the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">Crackpot Index</a> to these journals—provided he can pay the author's fee (which doesn't guarantee publication) and fill out the forms—and get accepted. The quality of science is of no matter, the money is.
</p>

<p>
  Another definition is given in the <i>Nature</i> paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y"><i>Predatory journals: no definition, no defence </i></a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Predatory journals and publishers are entities that prioritize self-interest at the expense of scholarship and are characterized by false or misleading information, deviation from best editorial and publication practices, a lack of transparency, and/or the use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices
</blockquote>

<p>
  The journal (read: predator) preys on the researcher who is desperate to get his paper published and another entry on his CV. This process can easily propagate and lead to worse science:
</p>

<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>

<p>
  What makes a journal predatory? Some researchers and organizations have published typical characteristics of predatory journals.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall">Jeffrey Beall</a> put out his own list in his short article <a href="https://beallslist.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/9/5/30958339/criteria-2015.pdf"><i>Criteria for Determining Predatory Open-Access Publishers</i></a>. Among these are obvious characteristics:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    The journal does not identify a formal editorial / review board.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evidence exists showing that the editor and/or review board members do not possess academic expertise to reasonably qualify them to be publication gatekeepers in the journal's field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy-proofs (locks) their PDFs, thus making it harder to check for plagiarism.
  </li>
  <li>
    The publisher dedicates insufficient resources to preventing and eliminating author misconduct, to the extent that the journal or journals suffer from repeated cases of plagiarism, self-plagiarism, image manipulation, and the like.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use boastful language claiming to be a "leading publisher" even though the publisher may only be a startup or a novice organization.
  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And non-obvious:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is little or no geographical diversity among the editorial board members, especially for journals that claim to be international in scope or coverage.
  </li>
  <li>
    The publisher asks the corresponding author for suggested reviewers and the publisher subsequently uses the suggested reviewers without sufficiently vetting their qualifications or authenticity. (This protocol also may allow authors to create faux online identities in order to review their own papers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Operate in a Western country chiefly for the purpose of functioning as a vanity press for scholars in a developing country (e.g., utilizing a maildrop address or PO box address in the United States, while actually operating from a developing country).
  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Another list was published by Eriksson and Helgesson in their 2016 paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11019-016-9740-3"><i>The false academy: predatory publishing in science and bioethics</i></a>. Their 25 characteristics is seen below:
</p>

<img src="media/25_characteristics.png" alt="25_characteristics" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">
  25 characteristics of a predatory journal—if you see many of these in a journal, run!
</figcaption>

<p>
  Combining these two lists and removing the minor entries, the primary items are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Nonexistent or poor peer review process
  </li>
  <li>
    Editors have nonexistent or poor credentials
  </li>
  <li>
    Published papers are of poor quality (as a result of the peer review process)
  </li>
  <li>
    Published papers represent a wide variety of subjects that are not necessarily related
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that these characteristics alone don't immediately qualify a journal as predatory, although some characteristics are much more suspect than others.
</p>

<h3 id="incidents">Incidents</h3>

<p>
  Arguably the most famous incident regarding predatory journals is John Bohannon's work discussed in his paper, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60"><i>Who's Afraid of Peer Review?</i></a>

<h3 id="list">List</h3>

<p>
  Despite this blog's lack of readership, it never hurts to name and shame these journals more than they already are, which will never be enough!
