<h1 id="insurance">Is LTC Insurance Worth It?</h1>

<p>
  If someone carrying a concealed handgun has to use it defensively (i.e., shoot someone) and they are charged with a related crime, it is a wise idea to lawyer-up. But should that someone purchase LTC insurance, or just pay out-of-pocket?

<h2 id="lawyer_fees">Lawyer Fees</h2>

<p>
  It's difficult to estimate the cost of lawyer fees for situations like these. Every shooting situation varies wildly, from obvious (lower lawyer fees) to dubious (higher lawyer fees).
</p>

<p>
  So I turn to the most trusted source I know for information on this: the internet:

<p>
  People don't carry guns because they expect to use them, they carry them <i>in case</i> they need to use them.
