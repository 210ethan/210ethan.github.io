<h1 id="heat">Heat</h1>

<p>
  For most of my life I've hated spicy foods. Flamin' Hot Cheetos made my mouth burn and eyes water and anything with chili powder was promptly refused. But around the age of 20, my friend encouraged me to try sriracha sauce. I loved it. While hot at first, I got progressively used to it to the point of not noticing the heat. Since then, I try to get a different hot sauce every time I'm grocery shopping.
</p>

<p>
  All of this got me thinking: can you train your body to handle even the spiciest sauces/foods? Does getting up into the 100,000 range on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">Scoville scale</a> have potential for lasting damage on your body or taste buds? Would I be able to appreciate sauces on the low-end of the scale?
</p>

<p>
  My goals of this experiment are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Establish a rough timeline of spice tolerance and check the relationship. Does it take shorter, longer, or the same time to get adjusted to higher heats when compared to lower heats?
  </li>
  <li>
    Try a variety of sauces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat the <a href="https://www.mychunkysburgers.com/4-horsemen">4 Horsemen challenge</a> at Chunky's Burgers:
    <blockquote>
      ​Dubbed the "Hottest Burger on the Planet" by Travel Channel's Man V. Food. The "4 Horsemen" burgers contains fresh Jalapeno and Serrano peppers, a Habanero sauce, and the dreaded Ghost (Jolokia) pepper.
    </blockquote>
    I expect it to be a few years before I am able to do this.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To determine which hot sauces to use, I used the <a href="https://www.scovillescale.org/hot-sauce-scoville-scale/">Hot Sauce Scoville Scale</a>, which seems fairly comprehensive without too large of jumps between Scoville values.
</p>

<p>
  A few specific notes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I will stay with one hot sauce until I feel I've "mastered" it, then move onto the next one. Because I am a cheapskate, I'll try to make larger jumps between sauces and regulate intensity via quantity.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will start with a small amount and gradually increase towards "mastery".
  </li>
  <li>
    I will not necessary try every hot sauce on the list, as some sound unappealing and/or the jumps are too small (851 vs. 870 SHU is probably too small to tell the difference).
  </li>
  <li>
    Sauces will be used on scrambled eggs, chicken, and other meats.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below I summarize the sauces I tried and my experience with each by quarter.

<p>
  My current (30 January 2021) starting point is around 3,000 SHU via Tapatío Hot Sauce (Salsa Picante), so I will begin slightly higher.
</p>

<p>
  My hot sauces for this quarter were (in order):
