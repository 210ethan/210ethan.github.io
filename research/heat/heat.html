<h1 id="heat">Heat</h1>

<p>
  For most of my life I've hated spicy foods. Flamin' Hot Cheetos made my mouth burn and eyes water and anything with chili powder was promptly refused. But around the age of 20, my friend encouraged me to try sriracha sauce. I loved it. While hot at first, I got progressively used to it to the point of not noticing the heat. Since then, I try to get a different hot sauce every time I'm grocery shopping.
</p>

<p>
  All of this got me thinking: can you train your body to handle even the spiciest sauces/foods? Does getting up into the 100,000 range on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">Scoville scale</a> have potential for lasting damage on your body or taste buds? Would I be able to appreciate sauces on the low-end of the scale?
</p>

<p>
  My goals of this experiment are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Establish a rough timeline of spice tolerance and check the relationship. Does it take shorter, longer, or the same time to get adjusted to higher heats when compared to lower heats?
  </li>
  <li>
    Try a variety of sauces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat the <a href="https://www.mychunkysburgers.com/4-horsemen">4 Horsemen challenge</a> at Chunky's Burgers:
    <blockquote>
      ​Dubbed the "Hottest Burger on the Planet" by Travel Channel's Man V. Food. The "4 Horsemen" burgers contains fresh Jalapeno and Serrano peppers, a Habanero sauce, and the dreaded Ghost (Jolokia) pepper.
    </blockquote>
    I expect it to be a year or two before I am able to do this.

</ul>

<h2 id="physiology">Physiology</h2>

<p>
  Capsaicin is the source of spiciness felt whenever eating a so-called "spicy" food. Capsaicin <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5326624/">bonds with its receptor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1">TRPV1</a>, in the mouth and on the tongue. As Jonah Lehrer puts it in his article <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/why-does-spicy-food-taste-hot/">Why Does Spicy Food Taste Hot?</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    capsaicin - the active ingredient in spicy food - binds to a special class of vanilloid receptor inside our mouth called VR1 receptors. After capsaicin binds to these receptors, the sensory neuron is depolarized, and it sends along a signal indicating the presence of spicy stimuli.
  </p>
  <p>
    The real purpose of VR1 receptors is thermoreception, or the detection of heat. This means that they are supposed to prevent us from consuming food that will burn our sensitive flesh. (That's why our VR1 receptors are clustered in our tongue, mouth and skin.) As a result, when the receptors are activated by capsaicin, the sensation we experience is indelibly linked to the perception of temperature...But that pain is just an illusory side-effect of our confused neural receptors. There is nothing "hot" about spicy food.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The penultimate sentence shows how real damage [CITE]

<h3 id="scoville_scale">Scoville Scale</h3>

<p>
  Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_Scoville">Wilbur Scoville</a>, the Scoville scale measures the spiciness of peppers in units of Scoville Heat Units (SHU).
</p>

<p>
  Scoville's original paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0898140X15301944?via%3Dihub">Note on Capsicums</a>, describes the procedure of quantifying SHUs as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
  One grain of ground capsicum is macerated over night in 100 cc. of alcohol. After thorough shaking, filtered. This alcoholic solution is then added to sweetened water in definite proportions until a distinct but weak pungency is perceptible on the tongue.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In plain English from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">Scoville scale Wikipedia page</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  an exact weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol to extract the heat components (capsaicinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water. Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The problem with this is subjectivity: some tasters may have more sensitive palates than others, leading to different SHU values.

<h2 id="experiments">Turning Up the Heat</h2>

<p>
  To determine which hot sauces to use, I used the <a href="https://www.scovillescale.org/hot-sauce-scoville-scale/">Hot Sauce Scoville Scale</a>, which seems fairly comprehensive without too large of jumps between SHU values. I have noticed that these values differ slightly from other websites' values. I will only use the aforementioned link to maintain consistency. All links point to Amazon, but they can be found for much cheaper on other sites or in stores.
</p>

<p>
  A few specific notes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I will stay with one hot sauce until I feel I've "mastered" it, then move onto the next one. Because I am a cheapskate, I'll try to make larger jumps between sauces and regulate intensity via quantity.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will start with a small amount and gradually increase towards "mastery".
  </li>
  <li>
    I will not necessary try every hot sauce on the list, as some sound unappealing and/or the jumps are too small (851 vs. 870 SHU is probably too small to tell the difference).
  </li>
  <li>
    Sauces will be used on scrambled eggs, chicken, and other meats.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below I summarize the sauces I tried and my experience with each by quarter.

<h3 id="q1_2021">Q1 2021</h3>

<p>
  My current (30 January 2021) starting point is around 3,000 SHU with Tapatío Hot Sauce (Salsa Picante).
</p>

<p>
  My hot sauces for this quarter were (in order):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FZFITQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002FZFITQ&linkCode=as2&tag=scovillesca0e-20&linkId=2f1e494219088d5d001009f6506e9cee&th=1">Tabasco Habanero Pepper Sauce</a> (8,000 SHU, 30 January 2021 - 05 February 2021). This was not bad at all. I will make a more significant jump in the next sauce's SHU value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TABASCO-brand-Scorpion-Sauce/dp/B0742FLJ5Q">Tabasco Scorpion Sauce</a> (50,000 SHU, 05 February 2021 - xx xx 2021). Not too bad taking a quarter-spoonful straight, but after putting a generous amount on my pot roast, I definitely felt the burn. Will stay at this for a while, but still went ahead and ordered the next two sauces.
  </li>
