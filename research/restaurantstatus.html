  - this effect is already well-established. no need to run experiments. just tell people how they should spend their money.
  - can we mathematicize this? look at price vs. ability to tell vs. satisfaction

  - look at youtube videos and tally them up:

<h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2>

<p>
  People who claim to enjoy high-end restaurants because of the food rarely have the palate to distinguish the expensive meal from one at a medium-end restaurant, and, in some cases, low-end. Rather, their liking the restaurant is almost always a simple, not-frowned-upon method of signaling status to peers, regardless of whether or not they belong to the group they're trying to belong to. (Others reasons may include the atmosphere, service, uniqueness of the dishes offered, etc., but these are minor when compared to status.)
</p>

<p>
  I perform a literature review and run experiments.
</p>

<p>
  What's the motivation behind this? Why can't I just let people pay the money they want to eat where they want? The reason is two-fold:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Because I paid $140 for an extremely meh meal that I probably could've gotten for $100 less at any ol' strip mall joint. I want to see if people in general, including myself, can tell the difference between good and bad, so in the future I can choose restaurants accordingly. Why should I pay extra money for zero extra enjoyment. The status gains are beneath me.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because I want to expose the people for who they are: status chasers. Just come out and say it. Saying food is soooooo good just because of the name (and then finding out it isn't actually from said restaurant) is the adult equivalent of a teenager unknowingly drinking non-alcoholic beer and acting drunk.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="origins">Origins of High-Status Restaurants</h2>

<p>
  This prompts a few questions. Is the food at these high-status restaurants really that good and my palate just that bad? Is it people pretending to think it's good because it would be considered low status to not? And if yes, how did the restaurant originally become high status, especially newer ones?
</p>

<h3 id="exclusivity">Exclusivity</h3>

<p>
  Exclusivity of a restaurant is primarily determined by wealth via menu prices: the higher the price, the fewer the people who choose to afford it. If a restaurant sets its prices high immediately upon opening, patrons will assume it's good because of the price (because nothing can taste bad if the restaurant has a $$$ or $$$$ rating on Google!).
</p>

<h3 id="namerecognition">Name Recognition</h3>

<p>
  Name recognition is perhaps a subcategory of exclusivity, and goes with ingredient names (see truffles, caviar), chef names (see Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck), and restaurant brand (see Nobu, Capital Grille, Truluck's, etc.)
</p>

<h3>[FINISH</h3>

<p>
  The influence of price on rating is well-documented and, in other words, the lack of knowledge on price results in similar ratings between.

    <blockquote>
      increasing the price of a wine increases subjective reports of flavor pleasantness as well as blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area that is widely thought to encode for experienced pleasantness during experiential tasks
    </blockquote>
    See Fig. 1E for the main result. There may be something placebo-like going on for brain activation aspect, but then a cost-benefit analysis must come into play: is the difference in experienced pleasantness worth the difference in price?

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>
  The following experiments were suggested by a large language model (I had originally thought of experiments xx; the LLM takes credit for the remaining).
</p>

<p>
  Note that it's not necessary to test restaurants against each other in the same experiment (i.e., I don't need to have both a high- and low-end food available in the same session) because the palate "resets", making the taste of food absolute in most situations.
</p>

<p>
  Food types and restaurants to test (high vs. low):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sushi: Namo vs. Blue Sushi
  </li>
  <li>
    Burgers: Loro vs. Braum's
  </li>
  <li>
    American: xx vs. xx
  </li>
  <li>
    Italian: xx vs. Olive Garden
  </li>
  <li>
    Coffee: vs. Starbucks
  </li>
  <li>
    Dessert: vs. Tom Thumb/Kroger
  </li>
  <li>
    Wine:
  </li>
  <li>
    Whiskey:
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blind">Experiment 1: Blind Tasting</h3>

Have participants blind-taste food from high-status and low-status restaurants without knowing the source.
Ask them to rate the food on taste, presentation, and overall satisfaction.

<p>
  Participants are blindfolded and given food from either a high-end or low-end restaurant—they know the food type and nothing else about anything.
</p>



<h4>Results</h4>





<h3 id="price">Experiment 2: Price Information Manipulation</h3>

Serve the same dish to two groups: one group is told it’s from a high-end restaurant, and the other is told it’s from a low-cost eatery.
Compare their ratings to see if perceived price influences their evaluation.






<h4>Results</h4>





<h3 id="socialmedia">Experiment 3: Social Media Hype</h3>

Present food from the same restaurant to two groups but provide one group with rave reviews and social media hype about the place.
Measure the difference in their ratings and overall satisfaction.



<h4>Results</h4>













<!--
backup experiments

Longitudinal Study:
Over several weeks, have participants visit a mix of high-status and low-status restaurants without prior knowledge of the places.
Track their ratings and preferences over time to see if initial perceptions change with repeated exposure.


Value Comparison:
Compare participants’ ratings of meals from high-status and low-status restaurants in terms of value for money.
Analyze if higher prices correlate with higher perceived value despite actual taste and satisfaction levels.
