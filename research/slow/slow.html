<h1 id="slow">Slowing Time</h1>

<p>
  Time is our most valuable commodity bar none. Most everything else in the world can be replenished: money, our bodies, objects. Once time has passed, it is gone, never to return. By this, it only makes sense that we want to get the best experience of our time as possible. While time going fast is sometimes advantageous (go hold a plank for 5:00 min and tell me that you want to savor that time), slower is generally better. We never want our time with family or friends to end; we never want to leave the park during beautiful weather; we want our weekends to feel as long as possible before the dreaded Monday rears its ugly head.

<p>
  Here I examine ways to make time—both short- and long-term—feel slower.
