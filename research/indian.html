<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I like my food hot and spicy. It bothers me when I ask for it HOT and SPICY but the restaurant doesn't give it to me like that (for whatever reason). I think Indian restaurants are especially guilty of this, and I suspect it's because of the stereotype that white people can't handle spicy foods. So what better way to test this than an actual experiment?
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<h3>Food</h3>

<p>
  I will order some type of meat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindaloo">vindaloo</a> dish because it so well-known as a spicy dish.
</p>

<h3>Names</h3>

<p>
  I will use the name Steve Johnson for my American identity and Vikas Patil for my Indian identity. Vikas Patil was confirmed to be a very Indian name by my very Indian friend, so the restaurants should be none the wiser to being duped (and possibly exposed!).
</p>

<h3>Ordering</h3>

<p>
  I will order food online 30 minutes between each other. No special instructions will be included in the order. I will randomize which person, Steve or Vikas, goes first. I am not ordering at the same time because the restaurant may prepare both dishes together, ruining any possible difference, while ordering some time apart minimizes that risk but also increases the likelihood that the staff member preparing the dish is the same person.
</p>

<h3>Consumption</h3>

<p>
  This is where things get tricky, so I enlisted the help of TheMotte (see comment <a href="https://www.themotte.org/post/267/smallscale-question-sunday-for-january-1/48388?context=8#context">here</a>). My original plan is below:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Refrigerate for two (2) hours
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat up in the microwave
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark each dish with an "S" (Steve) or "V" (Vikas)
  </li>
  <li>
    Randomize dishes and blindfold myself
  </li>
  <li>
    Sample one dish and note spiciness on scale of 1-10
  </li>
  <li>
    Cleanse palate with milk to neutralize spice
  </li>
  <li>
    Sample remaining dish and note spiciness on scale of 1-10
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove blindfold and note down which food was spicier
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  But Rov_Scam suggested what I believe is a better method:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Divide each order into 10 bite-sized samples
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark bottom each dish with a number and write down which number corresponds to which order (e.g., 1-5 are Steve and 6-10 are Vikas)
  </li>
  <li>
    Refrigerate the samples for two hours and then renumber them without looking at the original numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    Take a bite or two of each sample unblinded to establish a baseline
  </li>
  <li>
    Taste each sample and write down your guess as to which order it is, under the assumption that the samples ordered under an Indian name will be spicier, and write down your guess next to the new numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    After you're finished, look match the new numbers with the original number to see what corresponds and check to see how many times you guessed correctly
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This is more robust, but I can also involve a friend or two to add more data points.

<h3>Shiva's Bar and Grill</h3>

<p>
  Chicken tikka masala at "medium" heat was ordered. I was a bit skeptical about how this would turn out because of the spiciness level options: this implies a bit more objectivity in the spiciness of dishes, taking out the subjective factor of Indian vs. non-Indian names. Other spiciness levels including "American hot", "Indian hot", and "mild". I believe that choosing a spicier level will lead to greater likelihood of distinction because non-Indian and Indian scales are different, the latter being much higher.
</p>

<p>
  All four of us noticed an obvious difference between the spiciness levels. I had three-ish bites from each, cleansing my palate with a LimonCello LaCroix between each, and every time I had the Indian dish (which again, was unbeknownst to me), I could tell it was much spicier. We all put the spicier dish forward, I checked the numbers, and sure enough, they matched the Indian dish.
