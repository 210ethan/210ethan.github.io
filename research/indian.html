<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I like my food hot and spicy. It bothers me when I ask for it HOT and SPICY but the restaurant doesn't give it to me like that (for whatever reason). I think Indian restaurants are especially guilty of this, and I suspect it's because of the stereotype that white people can't handle spicy foods. So what better way to test this than an actual experiment?
</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<h3>Food</h3>

<p>
  I will order some type of meat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindaloo">vindaloo</a> dish because it so well-known as a spicy dish.
</p>

<h3>Names</h3>

<p>
  I will use the name Steve Johnson for my American identity and Vikas Patil for my Indian identity. Vikas Patil was confirmed to be a very Indian name by my very Indian friend, so the restaurants should be none the wiser to being duped (and possibly exposed!).
</p>

<h3>Ordering</h3>

<p>
  I will order food online 15 minutes between each other. No special instructions will be included in the order. I will randomize which person, Steve or Vikas, goes first. I am not ordering at the same time because the restaurant may prepare both dishes together, ruining any possible difference, while ordering some time apart minimizes that risk but also increases the likelihood that the staff member preparing the dish is the same person.
</p>

<h3>Consumption</h3>

<p>
  Because one dish will be slightly cooler than the other, thus allowing me to know which name the cold/hot food is under, I will need to take both home and reheat to match temperatures:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Refrigerate for two (2) hours
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat up in the microwave
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark each dish with an "S" (Steve) or "V" (Vikas)
  </li>
  <li>
    Randomize dishes and blindfold myself
  </li>
  <li>
    Sample one dish and note spiciness on scale of 1-10
  </li>
  <li>
    Cleanse palate with milk to neutralize spice
  </li>
  <li>
    Sample remaining dish and note spiciness on scale of 1-10
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove blindfold and note down which food was spicier
  </li>
</ol>
