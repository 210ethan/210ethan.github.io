<p>
  This post was inspired by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/njfety/what_do_you_prioritize_when_looking_for_a_place/">u/--MCMC--'s r/slatestarcodex post</a> asking:
</p>

<blockquote>
  What do you prioritize when looking for a place to live? What does the happiness literature say gives most people the best bang for their buck?
</blockquote>

<p>
  This got me thinking about all the variables that come into play when searching for a place to live, both among and within cities, i.e., which city should one choose and where within the city:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Commute time
  </li>
  <li>
    Cost of living:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rent/housing prices
      </li>
      <li>
        Taxes
      </li>
      <li>
        Essential purchases
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Proximity to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Essentials: Grocers, schools (if children), home improvement (for fixing issues)
      </li>
      <li>
        Conveniences: Department stores, restaurants, internet access
      </li>
      <li>
        Hobbies: Gyms, greenspace, clubs (golf, tennis, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        Transportation: Public transit, airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Family
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential romantic partners
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Neighbors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Climate
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety and crime rate
  </li>
  <li>
    Noise levels
  </li>
  <li>
    Greenspace
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of these affect a majority of people negatively, while others only marginally. I attempt to rank these in order of importance of consideration to help the questioning reader more easily make a decision.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to note that there are tradeoffs in choosing where to live, and one can only get so many of their desires before having to sacrifice others. The infamous college choose-two triangle comes to mind:
</p>

<img src="media/living/choose2.png" class="center" style="width:300px">

<p>
  But the where-to-live question requires a shape with more sides and every option being considered:

<h2 id="commute">Commute</h2>

<p>
  Commuting is the bane of many people's existence. They wake up, sit in traffic for an hour, work their 8-9 hour shift, sit in traffic for another hour, then do it all again the next day. It's not hard to see how it can be draining on one's sou...happiness.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3jizSM6M0o" class="center"></iframe>

<p>
  The literature strongly supports this common sense notion.
</p>

<p>
  <b>I</b>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:ffffffff-866d-1ee0-0000-0000536ff1b9/10.04_stutzer-frey_08.pdf">Stress that Doesn’t Pay: The Commuting Paradox</a>, Stutzer and Frey examines commuting and its effects.
</p>

<p>
  There are many negative side effects associated with commuting:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Commuting is associated with many environmental stressors like noise, crowds, pollution and thermal conditions. Stress that doesn’t pay: the commuting paradox that cause negative emotional and physical reactions. Reactions depend, of course, not only on the time and distance involved in commuting, but also on other factors that interact with the stressors mentioned above. Commuting is more stressful when people are not in control of certain factors that can crop up during the drive to work, e.g. due to traffic congestion or when they are under considerable time pressure. The strain of commuting is associated with raised blood pressure, musculoskeletal disorders, lowered frustration tolerance and increased anxiety and hostility, being in a bad mood when arriving at work in the morning and coming home in the evening, increased lateness, absenteeism and turnover at work, as well as adverse effects on cognitive performance; see Koslowsky et al. (1995)
</blockquote>

<p>
  The benefits they discuss include lower housing costs or higher wages (to compensate for the longer commute and keep the employee), which can offset the commuting cost and even make a net positive. However, with all of the other problems associated with commuting, this fails to qualify as a legitimate benefit in my book.
</p>

<p>
  The results are fairly clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
  results indicate that there is a sizable negative correlation between commuting time and individuals’ well-being. For each subsequent quartile of longer commuting time, we find, on average, a lower reported satisfaction with life. While life satisfaction is 7.23 points, on average, for people who commute 10 minutes or less (first quartile), average satisfaction scores for the top fourth quartile (commuting time more than 30 minutes) is 6.99 points, i.e., 0.24 points lower.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  People who commute 22 minutes (one way), which is the mean commuting time in Germany, report, on average, a 0.103-point lower satisfaction with life. This phenomenon is robust to a wide range of possible response biases, and it is not explained by compensation at the level of households.
</blockquote>

<p>

<p>
  <a href="https://courses.washington.edu/cee416/method%20for%20characterizing%20daily%20life%20experience%20the%20day%20construction%20method.pdf">A Survey Method for Characterizing Daily Life Experience: The Day Reconstruction Method</a>, Kahneman et al. "assesses how people spend their time and how they experience the various activities and settings of their lives, combining features of time-budget measurement and experience sampling. Participants systematically reconstruct their activities and experiences of the preceding day with procedures designed to reduce recall biases".
</p>

<p>
  Commuting was the lowest valued positive mean affect field (3.45) and the third highest valued negative mean affect field (0.89), only behind "taking care of my children" (0.91, ouch!) and "working" (0.97).
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11116-019-09983-9.pdf">How commuting afects subjective wellbeing</a>, Clark et al. "presents fndings from analyses of the impact of commuting (time and mode) on multiple aspects of Subjective Well-Being (SWB), including: satisfaction with life overall and the SWB sub-domains of job satisfaction, satisfaction with leisure time availability and self-reported health. Measures of strain and mental health (GHQ-12) are also examined."
</p>

<p>
  A few highlights from the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
  It is found that longer commute times are associated with lower job and leisure time satisfaction, increased strain and poorer mental health.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Despite these negative associations with the SWB sub-domains, longer commute times were not associated with lower overall life satisfaction...Workers in England appear to be successful in balancing the negative aspects of commuting against the wider benefits, e.g. access to employment, earnings and housing.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Overall, the study indicates that shorter commute times and walkable commutes can contribute to improved SWB—particularly through the release of leisure time. But life satisfaction overall will only be maintained if the benefits of undertaking the commute (earnings and satisfactory housing/employment) are not compromised.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In her article <a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/commute-times-unhappiness-carpooling-productivity.html">Long Commutes Destroy Happiness, Research Shows. Here's What to Do About Them</a>, Zetlin explains tradeoffs as related to commute times:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Most economists — and most employers — think of commuting as a tradeoff, particularly in an economy where unemployment is low and people presumably have a wide choice of available jobs. You agree to a long commute, which you hate, in order to do a job that you love, or that pays well, or both. Or the long commute allows you to live in a larger or better home, with more access to grass and trees, or one that is closer to your spouse or partner's job. Assuming (as economists do) that people make rational choices, the dreariness of the commute is balanced by something else that improves your well-being, so that people with long commutes should not be fundamentally unhappier than everyone else.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Which matches with what Clark et al. found: "life satisfaction overall will only be maintained if the benefits of undertaking the commute (earnings and satisfactory housing/employment) are not compromised", i.e., the tradeoff is net-zero and positive. Thus, it's important to consider other factors in one's living situation. If other factors are good, a long commute may not be too bad. If they're not-so-good, the long commute may be bad.
</p>

<h3 id="traffic_vs_no_traffic">Traffic vs. No Traffic</h3>

<p>
  It's often reported (n < 10) that driving in minimal traffic is better than stop-and-go traffic even if the former takes longer. This can be a major factor to commuting: if there's a 60-minute, no traffic commute vs. a 30-minute, stop-and-go commute, which is better? Part of this is lack of control. There is nothing an individual can do about traffic: they are left powerless and must succumb to the traffic machine's will.

<p>
  In case shortening the commute is not an option, there are ways to mitigate its effects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Go in/leave early or go in/leave late, enough so rush hour traffic is avoided. Clear roads can provide significant time back.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take public transit and spend commute time doing something enjoyable. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging">Slugging</a> is another option.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find ways to <a href="../thoughts/driving.html">make commuting enjoyable</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Carpool with a friend/coworker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Listen to podcasts/new music.

    </ul>

<h2 id="cost_of_living">Cost of Living</h2>

<p>
  Cost of living (COL) determines someone's standard of living, thus encompassing everything one would spend money on: housing, food, fun, transportation, etc. It varies significantly based on location. <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/dallas-tx-vs-cleveland-oh">For example</a>, if I live in Dallas and make $100,000/year, I would need to make $86,000 to maintain my standard of living in Cleveland.
</p>

<p>
  While salaries often correlate to COL (i.e., higher COL means higher salary, else no one would move there), they do not necessarily <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/despite-wage-growth-the-average-american-suffers-as-cost-of-living-rises-at-a-faster-pace-2019-01-10">keep up with ever-increasing costs of living</a> caused by inflation.
</p>

<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>



<p>
  Rentfrow et al.'s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656609001780?via%3Dihub">Happy States of America: A state-level analysis of psychological, economic, and social well-being</a> found that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Median housing value and well-being were also strongly related, as can be seen in the scatterplot in the bottom left panel of Fig. 2. That relationship suggests that people are happier in places where housing is comparatively expensive. To determine whether that association reflected the links between well-being, income, and per capita GRP, we ran a partial correlation between housing values and well-being, controlling for GRP per capita and income. The results indicated that the relation between housing values and well-being remained significant (rs = .45, .37, p < .01, controlling for GRP per capita and income, respectively). As before, a non-linear relationship emerged, with the same set of states in the bottom, but with Hawaii and California as two extreme outliers in terms of housing values.

<h2 id="noise_levels">Noise Levels</h2>

<p>
  Noise can come in a variety of forms, most of which aren't welcome: traffic, alternative transportation (trains, ships, planes), emergency vehicles, neighbors, construction (albeit most construction is temporary in theory), events, and businesses.
</p>

<h3 id="noise_levels_traffic">Traffic</h3>

<p>
  Urban and Macá's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3709355/">Linking Traffic Noise, Noise Annoyance and Life Satisfaction: A Case Study</a> abstract states that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  traffic noise has a negative effect on residential satisfaction, but no significant direct or indirect effects on overall life satisfaction. Noise annoyance due to road and rail traffic noise has strong negative effect on residential satisfaction rather than on overall life satisfaction.
</blockquote>

<p>
  where residential satisfaction is defined as "one’s satisfaction with the quality of life in a specific area". Note that the model uses data from Czech cities nor did I attempt to understand the model's functions.
</p>

<p>
  So, how much of a role does residential satisfaction play into one's happiness? Mouratidis's <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X20301988">Commute satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and housing satisfaction as predictors of subjective well-being and indicators of urban livability</a> finds that:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Neighborhood satisfaction was found to relate to subjective well-being directly, but also indirectly via personal relationships satisfaction, housing satisfaction, and leisure satisfaction. Housing satisfaction was found to have a significant direct association with subjective well-being.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Assuming these correlations are transitive, noise annoyance due to road and rail traffic noise has a significant affect on subjective well-being. My inclination is that it is heavily skewed towards the negative side, i.e., noise makes life considerably worse, while no noise <i>does not</i> make life considerably better.
</p>

<h3 id="noise_levels_transportation">Alternative Transportation</h3>

<p>
  Railroads are spoken for in the previous section, but I'll add a short supporting anecdote. In 2011 my family and I were in Alpine, TX, staying at a small inn near some train tracks. And that train would blare its horn every night for what the front desk worker told us were "safety reasons". Not fun!
</p>

<p>
  van Pragg and Baarsma's <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/76630/1/cesifo_wp1163.pdf">Using Happiness Surveys to Value Intangibles: The Case of Airport Noise</a> takes a different approach to the impact, choosing to "assess the monetary value of the noise damage, caused by aircraft noise nuisance around Amsterdam Airport as the sum of hedonic price differentials and a residual cost component".
</p>

[FINISH ANALYSIS OF PAPER ABOVE]

<p>
  And another anecdote, but this time airplane-related. My childhood home is less than a half-mile (0.8 km) being directly under the flight path of select arriving planes. The noise is loud enough that you have to pause phone conversations or videos when outside. While this is not <i>that</i> frequent, it is inconvenient. But like everything else, the tradeoff of getting all the other amenities in/around the neighborhood has allowed my family to look past it (not that my parents knew when they bought the house—apparently the realtor took them at stratetic times to avoid any plane noise!).
</p>

<p>
  I do not think that boats or oceanliners pose an issue to where one chooses to live. Residential areas are often too far to be affected by these vehicles.
</p>

<h3 id="noise_levels_emergency">Emergency Vehicles</h3>

<p>
  While these can get lumped into the <a href="noise_levels_traffic">Traffic</a> section, I think they merit their own section.
</p>

<p>
  Living next to a police station or fire station has its perks for when either service is needed quickly, but the likelihood that it is needed is slim. But the likelihood that someone else—anyone else—needs it is <i>much</i> higher.
</p>

<p>
  According to <a href="https://www.extremetacticaldynamics.com/knowledge-base/emergency-vehicle-sirens/police-sirens/#:~:text=Most%20emergency%20vehicle%20sirens%20create,low%20on%20the%20front%20bumper">Extreme Tactical Dynamics</a> (and other sources not listed here), "Most emergency vehicle sirens create 110-120 decibels when turned on. Police sirens can sound louder than ambulances or fire trucks because cop cars usually have their siren mounted low on the front bumper". 120 dB is the established threshold of discomfort, and examples include rock bands, chainsaws, and subway trains. And while the 120 dB noise <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Acoustic/isprob2.html">decreases by the inverse square law</a>, it'll stil be loud enough to hear when close, and especially when not inside the home.
</p>

<p>
  Now how often do emergency vehicles get called? Police incidents will be ignored, as they often turn their sirens on while out patrolling. Fire incidents will be focused on, as they hang out in the station until they're needed. <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Emergency-Responders/Fire-department-calls">NFPA statistics</a> say there were 36,416,000 fire department calls in 2020 between <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Emergency-Responders/US-fire-department-profile">29,537 fire departments</a>, giving an average of 1240 calls per department, or just over three calls per day per department. (I suspect this follows a rough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>, but there are no statistics on that.)
</p>

<p>
  Assuming a total time of 30 seconds per interruption (time from when the siren is first heard to last heard), that's 1:30 min per day of decently-loud noise interruption.
</p>

<h3 id="noise_levels_neighbors">Neighbors</h3>

<p>
  No literature was found for this, but I suspect happiness is negatively correlated. I've never met someone who wants to hear their neighbors: their coughing, their laughing, their talking, their private time, their media. It's all a drain and skewed negatively, just like traffic.
</p>

<h3 id="noise_levels_construction">Construction</h3>

<p>
  Construction is temporary and will rarely (with the exception of a few special circumstances) last more than a year, making it a subjective factor to consider. A few thoughts and questions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How long will I live here? If for many years, one year of construction isn't too bad.
  </li>
  <li>
    What days do the construction crews work? What time do they start?
  </li>
  <li>
    How loud is it?
