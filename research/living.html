  This post was inspired by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/njfety/what_do_you_prioritize_when_looking_for_a_place/">u/--MCMC--'s r/slatestarcodex post</a> asking:

<blockquote>
  What do you prioritize when looking for a place to live? What does the happiness literature say gives most people the best bang for their buck?
</blockquote>

<p>
  This got me thinking about all the variables that come into play when searching for a place to live, both among and within cities, i.e., which city should one choose and where within the city:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cost of living: Rent/housing prices, taxes, essential purchases
  </li>
  <li>
    Commute time
  </li>
  <li>
    Proximity to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Essentials: Grocers, schools (if children), home improvement (for fixing issues)
      </li>
      <li>
        Conveniences: Department stores, restaurants, internet access
      </li>
      <li>
        Hobbies: Gyms, greenspace, clubs (golf, tennis, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        Transportation: Train, bus, airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Family
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential romantic partners
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Neighbors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Climate
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety and crime rate
  </li>
  <li>
    Noise levels
  </li>
  <li>
    Greenspace
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of these affect a majority of people negatively, while others only marginally. I attempt to rank these in order of importance of consideration to help the questioning reader more easily make a decision.

<h2 id="commute">Commute</h2>

<p>
  Commuting is the bane of many people's existence. They wake up, sit in traffic for an hour, work their 8-9 hour shift, sit in traffic for another hour, then do it all again the next day. It's not hard to see how it can be draining on one's sou...happiness.

<p>
  The literature strongly supports this common sense notion.

<p>
  <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:ffffffff-866d-1ee0-0000-0000536ff1b9/10.04_stutzer-frey_08.pdf">Stress that Doesn’t Pay: The Commuting Paradox</a>, Stutzer and Frey examines commuting and its effects.
</p>

<p>
  There are many negative side effects associated with commuting:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Commuting is associated with many environmental stressors like noise, crowds, pollution and thermal conditions. Stress that doesn’t pay: the commuting paradox that cause negative emotional and physical reactions. Reactions depend, of course, not only on the time and distance involved in commuting, but also on other factors that interact with the stressors mentioned above. Commuting is more stressful when people are not in control of certain factors that can crop up during the drive to work, e.g. due to traffic congestion or when they are under considerable time pressure. The strain of commuting is associated with raised blood pressure, musculoskeletal disorders, lowered frustration tolerance and increased anxiety and hostility, being in a bad mood when arriving at work in the morning and coming home in the evening, increased lateness, absenteeism and turnover at work, as well as adverse effects on cognitive performance; see Koslowsky et al. (1995)
</blockquote>

<p>
  The benefits they discuss include lower housing costs or higher wages (to compensate for the longer commute and keep the employee), which can offset the commuting cost and even make a net positive. However, with all of the other problems associated with commuting, this fails to qualify as a legitimate benefit in my book.
</p>

<p>
  The results are fairly clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
  results indicate that there is a sizable negative correlation between commuting time and individuals’ well-being. For each subsequent quartile of longer commuting time, we find, on average, a lower reported satisfaction with life. While life satisfaction is 7.23 points, on average, for people who commute 10 minutes or less (first quartile), average satisfaction scores for the top fourth quartile (commuting time more than 30 minutes) is 6.99 points, i.e., 0.24 points lower.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  People who commute 22 minutes (one way), which is the mean commuting time in Germany, report, on average, a 0.103-point lower satisfaction with life. This phenomenon is robust to a wide range of possible response biases, and it is not explained by compensation at the level of households.

  <a href="https://courses.washington.edu/cee416/method%20for%20characterizing%20daily%20life%20experience%20the%20day%20construction%20method.pdf">A Survey Method for Characterizing Daily Life Experience: The Day Reconstruction Method</a>, Kahneman et al. "assesses how people spend their time and how they experience the various activities and settings of their lives, combining features of time-budget measurement and experience sampling. Participants systematically reconstruct their activities and experiences of the preceding day with procedures designed to reduce recall biases".
</p>

<p>
  Commuting was the lowest valued positive mean affect field (3.45) and the third highest valued negative mean affect field (0.89), only behind "taking care of my children" (0.91, ouch!) and "working" (0.97).
