  This post was inspired by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/njfety/what_do_you_prioritize_when_looking_for_a_place/">u/--MCMC--'s r/slatestarcodex post</a> asking:

<blockquote>
  What do you prioritize when looking for a place to live? What does the happiness literature say gives most people the best bang for their buck?
</blockquote>

<p>
  This got me thinking about all the variables that come into play when searching for a place to live, both among and within cities, i.e., which city should one choose and where within the city:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cost of living: Rent/housing prices, taxes, essential purchases
  </li>
  <li>
    Commute time
  </li>
  <li>
    Proximity to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Essentials: Grocers, schools (if children), home improvement (for fixing issues)
      </li>
      <li>
        Conveniences: Department stores, restaurants, internet access
      </li>
      <li>
        Hobbies: Gyms, greenspace, clubs (golf, tennis, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        Transportation: Public transit, airport
      </li>
      <li>
        Friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Family
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential romantic partners
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential friends
      </li>
      <li>
        Neighbors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Climate
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety and crime rate
  </li>
  <li>
    Noise levels
  </li>
  <li>
    Greenspace
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of these affect a majority of people negatively, while others only marginally. I attempt to rank these in order of importance of consideration to help the questioning reader more easily make a decision.
</p>

<p>
  It's important to note that there are tradeoffs in choosing where to live, and one can only get so many of their desires before having to sacrifice others.

<h2 id="commute">Commute</h2>

<p>
  Commuting is the bane of many people's existence. They wake up, sit in traffic for an hour, work their 8-9 hour shift, sit in traffic for another hour, then do it all again the next day. It's not hard to see how it can be draining on one's sou...happiness.
</p>

<p>
  The literature strongly supports this common sense notion.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:ffffffff-866d-1ee0-0000-0000536ff1b9/10.04_stutzer-frey_08.pdf">Stress that Doesn’t Pay: The Commuting Paradox</a>, Stutzer and Frey examines commuting and its effects.
</p>

<p>
  There are many negative side effects associated with commuting:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Commuting is associated with many environmental stressors like noise, crowds, pollution and thermal conditions. Stress that doesn’t pay: the commuting paradox that cause negative emotional and physical reactions. Reactions depend, of course, not only on the time and distance involved in commuting, but also on other factors that interact with the stressors mentioned above. Commuting is more stressful when people are not in control of certain factors that can crop up during the drive to work, e.g. due to traffic congestion or when they are under considerable time pressure. The strain of commuting is associated with raised blood pressure, musculoskeletal disorders, lowered frustration tolerance and increased anxiety and hostility, being in a bad mood when arriving at work in the morning and coming home in the evening, increased lateness, absenteeism and turnover at work, as well as adverse effects on cognitive performance; see Koslowsky et al. (1995)
</blockquote>

<p>
  The benefits they discuss include lower housing costs or higher wages (to compensate for the longer commute and keep the employee), which can offset the commuting cost and even make a net positive. However, with all of the other problems associated with commuting, this fails to qualify as a legitimate benefit in my book.
</p>

<p>
  The results are fairly clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
  results indicate that there is a sizable negative correlation between commuting time and individuals’ well-being. For each subsequent quartile of longer commuting time, we find, on average, a lower reported satisfaction with life. While life satisfaction is 7.23 points, on average, for people who commute 10 minutes or less (first quartile), average satisfaction scores for the top fourth quartile (commuting time more than 30 minutes) is 6.99 points, i.e., 0.24 points lower.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  People who commute 22 minutes (one way), which is the mean commuting time in Germany, report, on average, a 0.103-point lower satisfaction with life. This phenomenon is robust to a wide range of possible response biases, and it is not explained by compensation at the level of households.
</blockquote>

  <a href="https://courses.washington.edu/cee416/method%20for%20characterizing%20daily%20life%20experience%20the%20day%20construction%20method.pdf">A Survey Method for Characterizing Daily Life Experience: The Day Reconstruction Method</a>, Kahneman et al. "assesses how people spend their time and how they experience the various activities and settings of their lives, combining features of time-budget measurement and experience sampling. Participants systematically reconstruct their activities and experiences of the preceding day with procedures designed to reduce recall biases".
</p>

<p>
  Commuting was the lowest valued positive mean affect field (3.45) and the third highest valued negative mean affect field (0.89), only behind "taking care of my children" (0.91, ouch!) and "working" (0.97).
</p>

<p>
  <b>III</b>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11116-019-09983-9.pdf">How commuting afects subjective wellbeing</a>, Clark et al. "presents fndings from analyses of the impact of commuting (time and mode) on multiple aspects of Subjective Well-Being (SWB), including: satisfaction with life overall and the SWB sub-domains of job satisfaction, satisfaction with leisure time availability and self-reported health. Measures of strain and mental health (GHQ-12) are also examined."
</p>

<p>
  A few highlights from the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
  It is found that longer commute times are associated with lower job and leisure time satisfaction, increased strain and poorer mental health.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Despite these negative associations with the SWB sub-domains, longer commute times were not associated with lower overall life satisfaction...Workers in England appear to be successful in balancing the negative aspects of commuting against the wider benefits, e.g. access to employment, earnings and housing.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Overall, the study indicates that shorter commute times and walkable commutes can contribute to improved SWB—particularly through the release of leisure time. But life satisfaction overall will only be maintained if the benefits of undertaking the commute (earnings and satisfactory housing/employment) are not compromised.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In her article <a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/commute-times-unhappiness-carpooling-productivity.html">Long Commutes Destroy Happiness, Research Shows. Here's What to Do About Them</a>, Zetlin explains tradeoffs as related to commute times:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Most economists — and most employers — think of commuting as a tradeoff, particularly in an economy where unemployment is low and people presumably have a wide choice of available jobs. You agree to a long commute, which you hate, in order to do a job that you love, or that pays well, or both. Or the long commute allows you to live in a larger or better home, with more access to grass and trees, or one that is closer to your spouse or partner's job. Assuming (as economists do) that people make rational choices, the dreariness of the commute is balanced by something else that improves your well-being, so that people with long commutes should not be fundamentally unhappier than everyone else.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Which matches with what Clark et al. found: "life satisfaction overall will only be maintained if the benefits of undertaking the commute (earnings and satisfactory housing/employment) are not compromised", i.e., the tradeoff is net-zero and positive. Thus, it's important to consider other factors in one's living situation. If other factors are good, a long commute may not be too bad. If they're not-so-good, the long commute may be bad.

<h3 id="commute_suggestions">Commute Suggestions</h3>

<p>
  In case shortening the commute is not an option, there are ways to mitigate its effects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Go in/leave early or go in/leave late, enough so rush hour traffic is avoided. Clear roads can provide significant time back.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take public transit and spend commute time doing something enjoyable. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging">Slugging</a> is another option.
  </li>
  <li>
    Read <a href="../thoughts/driving.html">Making Driving Enjoyable</a> and apply its suggestions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost_of_living">Cost of Living</h2>

<p>
  Cost of living (COL) determines someone's standard of living, thus encompassing everything one would spend money on: housing, food, fun, transportation, etc. It varies significantly based on location. <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/dallas-tx-vs-cleveland-oh">For example</a>, if I live in Dallas and make $100,000/year, I would need to make $86,000 to maintain my standard of living.
</p>

<p>
  While salaries often correlate to COL (i.e., higher COL means higher salary, else no one would move there), they do not necessarily <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/despite-wage-growth-the-average-american-suffers-as-cost-of-living-rises-at-a-faster-pace-2019-01-10">keep up with ever-increasing costs of living</a> caused by inflation.
