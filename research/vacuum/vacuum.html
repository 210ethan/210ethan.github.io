<h1>Vacuum: Theory and Technologies</h1>

<p>
  This article can be described as a long review of John O'Hanlon's <i>A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology</i> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/802629.A_User_s_Guide_to_Vacuum_Technology?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=E2hLJSfe8C&rank=1">Goodreads</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471270520/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sin?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb_sin-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0471270520&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">Amazon</a>). O'Hanlon's book is a comprehensive resource on vacuum technology, especially as related to semiconductor processing. Other resources are used where O'Hanlon's textbook is lacking in quality or mention, i.e., O'Hanlon does not discuss it in his book.

<h2 id="what_is_pressure">What is Pressure?</h2>

<p>
  Pressure is defined by the simple equation:
</p>

\[P = \frac{F}{A}\]

<p>
  where \(P\) is pressure, \(F\) is force, and \(A\) is the area the force is exerted on. A common experiment to show this equation in-action is laying on a bed of nails: if \(F\) (the person's body) stays constant and \(A\) (the area of the bed) is large, the pressure exerted on the skin will be minimized, preventing penetration. But if it's a single nail...
</p>

<img src="media/bed_nails.jpeg" alt="bed_nails" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">The ultimate torture devi... wait, this doesn't hurt!</figcaption>

<p></p>

<p>
  Now that pressure has been shown with an actual body (literally!) of mass, what about pressure that is invisible, e.g., air?
</p>

<p>
  From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution">Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</a>, which is used to find the distribution of the speeds of particles within an ideal gas, the N<sub>2</sub> molecule at a temperature of 0 °C moves at a probable speed of:
</p>

\[v_{p, \text{N}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{m_{\text{N}_{2}}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(1.380 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{K}^{-1})(273 \, \text{K})}{2 \times 2.33 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}}} \approx 400 \, \text{m/s}\]

<p>
  where \(k_{B}\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann constant</a>, \(T\) is temperature, and \(m\) is the particle's mass.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square#Speed">root-mean-squared speed</a> is found by:
</p>

\[v_{\text{rms}, \, \text{N}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m_{\text{N}_{2}}}} \approx 500 \, \text{m/s}\]

<p>
  Quite fast! If a human got hit by a car going the same speed (900 mph, 1500 kph), they would surely die. The difference is the size of the object. The N<sub>2</sub> molecule has an insignificant mass of \(4.6 \times 10^{26}\) kg, resulting in a insignificant kinetic energy and not noticing its collisions. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_density">number density</a> of gases is extremely high, leading to many collisions and the experience of pressure. Number density can be found using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law>ideal gas law</a>:
</p>

\[\frac{n}{V} = N_{A} \times \frac{P}{RT}\]

<p>
  where \(N_{A}\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Avogadro's constant</a>, \(R\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant">gas constant</a>, and \(V\) is a unit volume (either 1 cm<sup>3</sup> or 1 m<sup>3</sup>).
</p>

<p>
  Two others terms need to be defined:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Mean free path</b>: The average distance a particle travels in a system before colliding with another particle. These distances can vary from &#956;m all the way up to km for ultra-high vacuum systems. The MFP equation is given by:

    \[\lambda = \frac{k_{B}T}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^{2}P}\]

    where \(d\) is the particle diameter and \(P\) is the pressure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Particle flux</b>: The rate at which particles strike a surface, allowing the measurement of pressure within a system.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
  Pressure has many units:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Torr (symbol: Torr or mmHg, millimeters of mercury)</b>: Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</a> and his barometer experiments, 1 Torr is the amount of pressure needed to support a 1 mm-tall column of Hg at 0 °C and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity">standard gravity</a>. 760 Torr is the standard atmospheric pressure at sea-level. Note that "torr" is the unit name and "Torr" is the symbol.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Standard atmosphere (symbol: atm)</b>: Pressure at sea-level. 1 atm = 101.325 Pa = 14.7 psi = 760 Torr.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Bar (symbol: bar)</b>: 1 bar = 100,000 Pa.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pascal (symbol: Pa)</b>: The derived <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/metric-si/si-units">SI unit</a> for pressure: \[1 \, \text{Pa} = 1 \, \frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^{2}}\]
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Pounds per square inch (symbol: psi)</b>: <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=freedom%20units">Freedom units</a> of pressure.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gas_flow">Gas Flow</h2>

<p>
  There are three flow regimes, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudsen_number">Knudsen number</a>:
</p>

\[\text{Kn} = \frac{\lambda}{L} = \frac{k_{B}T}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^{2}PL}\]

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Continuum flow</b> (Kn < 0.01): Occurs under high pressure (low MFP) and can be either viscous or turbulent. Gases often collide with each other and chamber walls.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Molecular flow</b> (Kn > 1): Occurs under low pressures (high MFP). Gases rarely collide with each other and often collide with the chamber walls.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Transition region</b> (0.01 < Kn < 1): Gases collide with each other and chamber walls.
  </li>
</ul>

<img src="media/gas_flow_regimes.gif" alt="gas_flow_regimes" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Gas flow regimes illustrated</figcaption>

<p>
  With these flow regimes come more terms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Throughput</b> (energy per time): The amount of gas passing through an area in a given time, or the amount of energy required to transport the gas across the area.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Mass flow</b> (amount in kg, kg-moles, molecules): Amount passing through the area.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Conductance</b> (volume per time): Given a throughput of \(Q\) within a pipe that has a pressure differential, conductance is calculated by:
    \[C = \frac{Q}{P_{2} - P_{1}}\]
    Conductances add in parallel and diminish in series:
    \[C_{p} = C_{1} + ... + C_{n}\]
    \[\frac{1}{C_{s}} = \frac{1}{C_{1}} + ... + \frac{1}{C_{n}}\]
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what_is_vacuum">What is Vacuum?</h2>

<p>
  Vacuum is formally <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vacuum">defined</a> as "a space entirely devoid of matter." In regards to practical definitions, it is a space that has a lower pressure (or lower amount of particles) than its surroundings, all other variables kept equal.
</p>

<p>
  There are also two types of pressure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Positive</b>: Occurs when the space has a higher pressure than its surroundings. Leaks will cause the contents of the high-pressure system to diffuse into the low-pressure system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Negative</b>: Occurs when the space has a lower pressure than its surroundings. Leaks will cause the contents of the high-pressure system to diffuse into the low-pressure system. Vacuum systems are always under negative pressure.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vacuum_levels">Vacuum Levels</h3>

<p>
  There are ranges of pressure that correspond to specific "levels" of vacuum:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    Vacuum levels: note that the higher the vacuum, the lower the pressure

<h4 id="perfect_vacuum">Is Perfect Vacuum Possible?</h4>

<p>
  Yes and no, depending on how it is looked at it.
</p>

<p>
  Deep space is almost entirely devoid of particles, and there are surely volumes that can be outlined to exclude any surrounding particles, making them "perfect vacuum" volumes. However, there are still some elements contained within the chosen volume—photons, energy, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle">virtual particles</a> all exist, preventing an absolutely-perfect vacuum from being achieved.
</p>

<p>
  A group of German researchers have achieved up to (or down to) 10<sup>-14</sup> Pa using a <a href="#cryo_pump">cryogenic pump</a> (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.253001">paper here</a>). Note that it is exponentially more expensive and time-consuming both to achieve and maintain higher-vacuum systems and arguably has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> (the thin film or image you produce will likely not be significantly better at 10<sup>-10</sup> Torr than it will be 10<sup>-9</sup> Torr).
</p>

<h2 id="measurement">Vacuum Measurement</h2>

<p>
  Various gauges are used to measure pressure within a chamber. Direct-reading gauges directly measure the particle flux, while indirect-reading gauges [FINISH]
</p>

<figcaption align="middle">Ranges of various vacuum gauges</figcaption>

<h3 id="direct_reading_gauges">Direct-Reading Gauges</h3>

<p>
  Liquid wall manometers use a U-shaped tube liquid to compare a known pressure to an unknown pressure. For example, if P<sub>1</sub> is under an unknown vacuum and P<sub>2</sub> is at atmospheric pressure, then P<sub>2</sub> will "push" harder than P<sub>1</sub>, causing the P<sub>1</sub> liquid level to rise and resulting in a pressure reading of:
</p>

\[P = \rho gh\]

<p>
  where \(\rho\) is the fluid's density and \(h\) is the height difference in the liquids.
</p>

<img src="media/manometer.jpeg" alt="manometer" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Manometer liquid levels at three different pressures</figcaption>

  Solid wall DRGs include the diaphragm gauge, the Bourdon tube, and capacitance manometer.

</iframe>
<figcaption align="middle">
  An animation showing the operation of the diaphragm and Bourdon gauges
</figcaption>

<p>
  The capacitance manometer is a derivative of the diaphragm gauge, where the pressure reading is determined by the change in capacitance between the diaphragm itself and an electrode. Capacitance is found by:
</p>

\[C = \epsilon \frac{A}{d}\]

<p>
  where \(\epsilon_{0}\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity">permittivity</a> of medium, \(A\) is the area of the two plates, and \(d\) is the distance between the plates.
</p>

<p>
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_sensor">pressure transducer</a> is used to measure the pressure. A diaphragm is fixed between two miniature chambers, one at the unknown pressure, where the electrode is located, and one evacuated. As the pressure changes, the diaphragm moves in one direction, changing the capacitance the electrode senses and sending it to the tool. The diaphragm movement is extremely small, making it susceptible to temperature effects. To counteract this, some transducers are equipped with heaters to maintain a specific temperature.
</p>

<h3 id="indirect_reading_gauges">Indirect-Reading Gauges</h3>

<h4 id="thermal_conductivity_gauges">Thermal Conductivity Gauges</h4>

<p>
  The TGC measures pressure by measuring heat transfer between a wire and the closed-volume the wire is in. As pressure increases within a certain range, heat transfer also increases linearly, allowing an accurate, medium-vacuum pressure to be read if characterization is accurate.
</p>

<p>
  To form a Pirani gauge, an already-balanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge">Wheatstone bridge</a> is used, where one of the resistors is the wire that will be heated in the vacuum. Resistance increases with temperature:
</p>

\[R(T) = R_{0}\left(1 - \alpha(T - T_{0})\right)\]

<p>
  where \(R_{0}\) is the initial resistance at initial temperature \(T_{0}\), \(\alpha\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_coefficient">temperature coefficient</a>, and \(T\) is the current temperature.
</p>

<p>
  As pressure increases on the heating wire, the heat transfer increases (or heat loss occurs) and the resistance decreases. To rebalance the bridge, the voltage source must supply more voltage, thus reheating the wire back to its original resistance and rebalancing the bridge. The voltage can then be read into a transducer to measure the pressure. A compensating wire is used to offset any effects from temperature on the resistance zeroing of the heated wire.
</p>

<img src="media/pirani_wheatstone.gif" alt="pirani_wheatstone" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Pirani gauge configuration using a Wheatstone bridge</figcaption>

<p>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple">thermocouple</a> gauge uses a thermocouple to measure the pressure: higher pressures decrease the wire's temperature. Characterizing this curve allows for accurate measurements.
</p>

<p>
  Ionization gauges are used to measure ultra-high vacuum pressures. There are two types: hot cathode and cold cathode.
</p>

<p>
  In the hot cathode, keeping the temperature constant allows the pressure to be read via the number of positive ions measured by the negatively-biased collector electrode. Bayard and Alpert invented the most popular and common design of the ionization gauge in their paper that eliminated the misleading effects of x-ray-generated photocurrent, <a href="https://github.com/ethanmorse/ethanmorse.github.io/blob/master/research/vacuum/media/Extension%20of%20the%20Low%20Pressure%20Range%20of%20the%20Ionization%20Gauge.pdf"><i>Extension of the Low Pressure Range of the Ionization Gauge</i></a>. The Bayard-Alpert gauge can measure as low as 10<sup>-8</sup> Pa = 8 &times 10<sup>-10</sup> Torr.
</p>

<p>
  In the cold cathode gauge, electric and magnetic fields present within the gauge increase ionization probability. Electron sources are also used to increase the initial number of starting electrons available to ionize the gases. The pressure range is a bit wider than the hot cathode gauge, allowing pressures from 1-10<sup>-9</sup> Pa = 10<sup>-2</sup>-10<sup>-11</sup> Torr to be read.
</p>

<h2 id="flow_speed">Flow (In and Out)</h2>

<h3 id="mass_flow_measurement">Mass Flow Measurement</h3>

<p>
  The flow of a gas (which has mass) can be measured by applying heat to a gas flow and checking the temperature increase, which is proportional to the amount of mass flowing. Two types of thermal flow meters can be used: variable temperature and constant temperature. The variable temperature uses two thermocouples placed at either ends of the flow channel. After taking an initial temperature measurement with no gas flowing, gas is flowed through and the thermocouples take another temperature measurement, allowing for an accurate measurement of the mass flow. The constant temperature uses a circuit to maintain a constant temperature throughout the channel, where the applied power is proportional to the mass flow.
</p>

<p>
  The mass flow controller (MFC) is an obvious progression from the flow meter. By adding a analog valve that can be fully open, fully closed, or anywhere in between, the amount of mass flowing can easily be controlled. The MFC must be calibrated to the specific gas that it will be used for or have a gas correction factor (GCF) added. For example, an N<sub>2</sub>-based MFC (the most common calibration standard) will have a GCF of 1 when flowing N<sub>2</sub> and a GCF of 1.39 when flowing Ar. The equation for GFC is:
</p>

\[GCF = formula\]


<h3 id="pumping_speed">Pumping Speed</h3>

<p>
  While pumping speed has the same units as conductance, volume/time (m<sup>3</sup>/s, L/s), they are not the same: conductance is the property of the hardware, while pumping speed is dependent on the pump used, the current pressure, etc.
</p>

<p>
  To measure a <a href="#mechanical_pump">mechanical pump</a>s pumping speed, the system is brought down to base pressure, \(P_{b}\), gas, typically N<sub>2</sub>, is flowed into the chamber for a number of minutes, and finally the equilibrium pressure, \(P_{\text{eq}}\) is found, giving a pumping speed of:
</p>

\[S = \frac{Q}{P_{\text{eq}} - P_{b}}\]

<p>
  Measuring the pumping speed of higher vacuum pumps, such as the <a href="#turbo_pump">turbo pump</a> and <a href="#cryo_pump">cryo pump</a>, require similar methods due to their lack of pumping capability at high flows.
</p>

<img src="media/pumping_speed.jpeg" alt="pumping_speed" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Typical pumping speed vs. pressure curve</figcaption>

<p>
  Keep in mind that the calculated pumping speed is under idealized conditions. Instead, an effective pumping speed (EPS) is more accurate. Given a port conductance, \(C_{p}\), and ideal pumping speed, \(S\), EPS is calculated by:
</p>

\[\text{EPS} = \left(\frac{1}{C_{p}} + \frac{1}{S}\right)^{-1}\]

<p>
  From this equation, the smallest conductance results in the highest effective pumping speed given a fixed ideal pumping speed. Further:
</p>

\[\text{EPS} = \frac{V}{t} \ln\left(\frac{P_{0}}{P_{f}}\right) \quad (\text{molecular flow only})\]

<p>
  Where \(V\) is volume, \(t\) is time, \(P_{0}\) is the initial pressure, and \(P_{f}\) is final pressure.
</p>

<p>
  A few other, more practical methods are available for calculating EPS. Given a mass flow, MF, and pressure, \(P\), the EPS of either a transfer or capture pump is found by:
</p>

\[\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{MF}}{P}\]

<p>
  Another method for transfer pumps measures the throughput at the pump's exhaust then divides by the pressure within the chamber. This assumes no particles are lost between the chamber and exhaust, whether by condensing, a trap, etc. More calculations can be found <a href="https://www.lesker.com/newweb/technical_info/vacuumtech/pumps_12_calceps.cfm">here</a> (where all of this EPS information was taken from).
</p>

<h3 id="slow_pumping">Slow Pumping</h3>

<p>
  Slow chamber pump times can be reasonable or indicative of an issue with the chamber or pump itself.
</p>

<p>
  First, check if the pump time is reasonable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is the chamber large? Large chambers obviously take longer to evacuate than smaller.
  </li>
  <li>
    Is the chamber dirty? Deposition layers allow pockets of moisture and gases to form on the chamber walls, resulting in outgassing and longer pumping times.
  </li>
  <li>
    How big is the vacuum pump? Larger pumps allow faster pumping speeds.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  After those three questions have been eliminated in the search for a faster pumping time, examine the possible issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is there a possible outgassing source?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is there a leak? Test the chamber's leak rate and perform <a href="#leak_detection">leak detection</a> techniques to check for possible leaks into the chamber or vacuum lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Are the pumps bad? The pumps may need servicing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Are there contamination or outgassing sources? Lubrications, oils, and other foreign objects may contribute to rising pressures or poor pump performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to all of this, the pump times should be recorded on a regular basis to check for any times that are out of the ordinary. For example, the times it takes to pump down from atmosphere to 100, 1, 10<sup>-3</sup>, 10<sup>-5</sup>, and 10<sup>-7</sup> may all be recorded over time. Pump time behaviors may be more noticeable and easily anticipated after certain events, like chamber cleaning or pump replacement.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="achieving_vacuum">Achieving Vacuum</h2>

<p>
  Vacuum is achieved through the use of vacuum pumps. It is important to note that vacuum pumps do not "suck", nor is there is such a force as "suction".

<h3 id="leak_detection">Leak Detection</h3></h3>

<p>
  Before performing any leak testing, the system's pressure characteristics should be characterized: its pressure vs. time curve, base pressure, base leak rate (most chambers will have some type of leak rate if they're not being actively pumped), and base <a href="#rga">RGA</a> results.
</p>

<p>
  There are two types of leak detectors: the forward-flow (FFLD) and counter-flow (CFLD). Both use mass spectrometers (MS) calibrated to helium to detect leaks.
</p>

<h4 id="ffld">Forward-Flow Leak Detector</h4>

<p>
  The FFLD consists of two vacuum pumps (turbo and roughing), pressure gauge, MS, and inlet port, as well as appropriate valves to isolate the pumps at allowed pressures. The system is pumped down to high vacuum, then He sprayed around possible leaks. A LN<sub>2</sub> trap is used to prevent non-He particles from reaching the MS.
</p>

<h4 id="cfld">Counter-Flow Leak Detector</h4>

<p>
  The CFLD has a similar setup to the FFLD, but the MS is at the inlet of the turbo pump and there is no need for a LN<sub>2</sub> trap. The pump must have low compression ratios for He and high compression ratios for all other gases. This allows the high-ratio gases to be pumped more easily and not reach the MS, while He is not and reaches the MS more easily.
</p>

<img src="media/leak_detection.gif" alt="leak_detection" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">Leak detection schematic</figcaption>

<h4 id="techniques">Leak-Hunting Techniques</h4>

<p>
  The system being tested should be isolated one part at a time, eliminating sections systematically.
</p>

<p>
  First, the pump. Can the tool be brought down to basic roughing pressure? If not, there may be a leak or the pump needs to be serviced. Connect the pump directly to a gauge and check the pressure. If it fails to reach the expected pressure, the pump is likely bad. If it is as expected, move to checking the roughing line and foreline. Reconnect the pump and check each of those for expected base pressure.
</p>

<p>
  If neither the roughing pump, roughing line, nor foreline pose any issues, move to the main process chamber. Attempt to pump the chamber down to base pressure. If it fails to reach the expected pressure, there could be a few issues: bad high-vacuum pump, outgassing, and bad pressure gauge are all possible issues. Check the pressure on the pump side of the gate valve. If the pressure is low, then the pump is likely operating fine and there is a problem within the chamber itself. Outgassing will eventually stop, so continue pumping for a number of hours to eliminate that as a possible cause. Cleaning the chamber shields will also decrease outgassing.
</p>

<p>
  Once the high-vacuum pump and outgassing are eliminated as possibilities, the leak detector can be used. Begin at the top of the chamber with connections and work down. Once the chamber has been checked, other options may be examined using an RGA.
</p>

<p>
  Mass flow controllers (MFC) can pose issues by allowing gases into the chamber. If the tool is used for deposition, this is easily verified by running a non-reactive gas process, such as sputtering with only Ar and analyzing the results via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy">x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)</a>. If there is significant O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> present in the film but the O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> MFC valve was closed, there may be a leak through the MFC. This should be another characterization performed at regular intervals: when the system is verified to have no leaks, what does the XPS analysis yield for a standard process not using any additional gases.

<p>
  After the entire tool has been checked and eliminated, leaks should be checked all the way back to the gas cylinder (essentially closing the system). The RGA will likely also verify the leak is coming from the atmosphere. The analysis should yield higher values of N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, etc. Close the gas cylinder and evacuate the gas lines through the leak detector, then begin He testing. It may take a bit for the He to travel from the leak location to the MS, so wait a number of seconds (up to 30 s), between He injections.

<h3 id="rga">Residual Gas Analysis</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_gas_analyzer">Residual gas analyzers (RGA)</a> are simply mass spectrometers used for finding the composition of gases within a volume, e.g., vacuum chamber. "Finding the composition" has a variety of uses:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#leak_detection"><b>Leak detection</b></a>: RGAs are used for checking if any undesirable gases are leaking into the chamber. If they are, the results provide an idea of where the source of the leak is.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gas purity: Some processes require ultra-high purity gases to work properly. Given the base pressure gas composition, the gas purity can be determined simply by flowing the gas into the chamber.
