<h1 id="self">Self-Testing</h1>

<p>
  This page serves as a place for me to keep track of tests (read: experiments) I run on myself. Methods are not necessarily rigorous, hence the use of "test", i.e., I am testing something on myself to see if how it works. Some tests deserve their own posts, but I will still link them below.
</p>

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</a>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 id="waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</h2>

<p>
  While in university, I woke up consistently at 5:00am Monday through Saturday, regardless of my (pretty consistent) bedtime. There were slip-ups, of course, but rarely. Besides the circadian consistency, one factor I think played a role in the easiness of getting up was I had a reason to each day, and one that I was excited for. Be it exercise, <a href="../../thoughts/aggiefab/aggiefab.html">work</a>, or doing some personal project, I always had something to work on in the morning. My phone turns to warm mode at least one hour before bed, and I don't use it much in bed.
</p>

<p>
  My life now is quite different. I don't enjoy work nearly as much, I prefer working on personal things in the evening, and my sleep schedule is a bit more wonky, but not by much:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    S: 7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    M: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    T: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    W: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    R: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    F: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    S: 6:00am
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of this leads to difficulty waking up in the morning, which I don't like. So, for this test I'll be waking up at the same time every morning for 30 days: 4:30am.
</p>

<p>
  This wake-up time will remain constant regardless of what time I go to bed or what I have to do in the morrow. I will attempt to keep both my bedtime and bedtime habits roughly constant. I generally read a non-fiction book for 15-30 min while lying down in bed with a warm-light lamp on. The room itself is 72-75 °F (22-24 °C), quite dark, and does not experience much sound besides muffled voices from my neighbors. I will have my last meal around two hours before bed and be well-hydrated throughout the day. I will also include notes on exercise intensity and duration.

<h2 id="trigger_action_plans">Trigger-Action Plans</h2>

<p>
  See my notes on trigger-action plans (TAP) <a href="../../knowledge/texts/notes/notes.html#trigger_action_plans">here</a>. I will define each entry concisely with the goal, trigger, and action, then discuss the actual practice and results of each.
</p>

<p>
  I've also converted all of these into Anki cards in the form of reminders, affirmations, or reinforcers. For example, a card for <a href="#being_present">being present</a> features a recording of me laughing on one side and the words "Be present!" on the other—whenever I hear the laugh, I think of being present. All cards have a maximum review interval of 1 day, so they are reviewed every day. (This idea is discussed in Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/things/software/anki/">Instilling Novel Thought Patterns and Making Your Long-Term Memory Accountable with Anki</a>, which I highly recommend reading and implementing. More on it <a href="#novel_thought_patterns">below</a>.)

<h3 id="out_bed_faster">Getting Out of Bed Faster</h3>

<p>
  My normal wake-up routine involves my first alarm going off, me going back to bed for 5 min, then finally laying in bed for 15 min after the second alarm goes off. The big problem with this is that I've trained my body to become sleepy when I lie horizontally, so by remaining in bed I stay sleepy. After getting up and moving around for a few minutes, I'm completely awake and ready to go. This TAP will streamline the me-becoming-fully-awake process and give me back 20 min of my morning.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Get out of bed within 1:00 min of my alarm going off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: My natural sunlight alarm clock playing music and my iPhone alarm playing its sound.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Turn on my bedside lamp, remove my covers, and stand up.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I will practice this throughout my <a href="#waking_up_same_time">waking up at the same time every day test</a>.
</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>
  This took about 5 times before it became an ingrained/natural behavior. Whenever I hear the alarm go off, I take the covers off, get out of bed, and start with my day. There were some days I only got 4:15 hr sleep (due to my <a href="#waking_up_same_time">waking up at the same time every day test</a>), but it was just as easy as the other days. Another thing that helps me is keeping up the habit: if I follow a habit and then stop, I tend to rationalize with myself that I don't have to start up again. If I were to lapse in the one-minute rule one day, it would be significantly harder to pick it back up again. See the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/">X effect</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Some suggestions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Having a warm room (72-75 °F, 22-24 °C) helps immensely. A cold room and warm bed make the bed even more inviting, while a warm room and warm bed make it "meh".
  </li>
  <li>
    Make your wake-up alarm a distinct sound from any other alarms you set. This may increase the strength of the trigger.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="being_present">Being Present</h3>

<p>
  The past couple of weeks I have been trying to truly enjoy individual moments: driving to work listening to music, riding my Airdyne in my apartment, walking in the nearby park. In doing so, I've found that I get much greater enjoyment and happiness out of focusing on how nice that moment is. However, sometimes it's difficult to remember to focus on this, hence my using a TAP.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: Gain greater enjoyment out of the enjoyable moments I am in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Me laughing (enjoying myself).
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Recognize how enjoyable the current moment is.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I use Anki to help reinforce this. The front of the card says "Be present!" and the back of the card is an audio recording of me laughing.

<h3 id="novel_thought_patterns">Novel Thought Patterns</h3>

<p>
  This idea is taken from and discussed in greater detail in Guzey's <a href="https://guzey.com/things/software/anki/">Instilling Novel Thought Patterns and Making Your Long-Term Memory Accountable with Anki</a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Goal: "have a certain thought you want to be having or an action you want to be doing".
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger: Visual (via Anki text and image) reminder of the thought/action.
  </li>
  <li>
    Action: Think the thought or perform the action.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below is a running list of the novel thoughts I am instilling. F: [text] | B: [text/picture] means the front and back of an Anki card. I try to make the text short and easy to remember and the picture of something I regularly see.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    F: &#60;3 minutes // B: If it takes less than 3 minutes, just do it! [Picture of trash can.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: Eat the frog! // B: Choosing the hardest task first makes the following ones easy. [Picture of a to-do list box checked off.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: Do I really want sugar? // B: No. This feeling will soon pass. [Picture of donuts, my favorite type of sugary food.]
  </li>
  <li>
    F: My <a href="../../thoughts/regret/regret.html#major_regrets">major regrets in life</a> // B: The lessons I learned from each regret.
  </li>
</ul>
