<h1 id="self">Self-Testing</h1>

<p>
  This page serves as a place for me to keep track of tests (read: experiments) I run on myself. Methods are not necessarily rigorous, hence the use of "test", i.e., I am testing something on myself to see if how it works.
</p>

<h2 id="waking_up_same_time">Waking Up at the Same Time Every Day</h2>

<p>
  While in university, I woke up consistently at 5:00am Monday through Saturday, regardless of my (pretty consistent) bedtime. There were slip-ups, of course, but rarely. Besides the circadian consistency, one factor I think played a role in the easiness of getting up was I had a reason to each day, and one that I was excited for. Be it exercise, <a href="../../thoughts/aggiefab/aggiefab.html">work</a>, or doing some personal project, I always had something to work on in the morning. My phone turns to warm mode at least one hour before bed, and I don't use it much in bed.
</p>

<p>
  My life now is quite different. I don't enjoy work nearly as much, I prefer working on personal things in the evening, and my sleep schedule is a bit more wonky, but not by much:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    S: 7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    M: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    T: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    W: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    R: 4:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    F: 6:30am
  </li>
  <li>
    S: 6:00am
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of this leads to difficulty waking up in the morning, which I don't like. So, for this test I'll be waking up at the same time every morning for 30 days: 4:30am.
</p>

<p>
  This wake-up time will remain constant regardless of what time I go to bed or what I have to do in the morrow. I will attempt to keep both my bedtime and bedtime habits roughly constant. I generally read a non-fiction book for 15-30 min while lying down in bed with a warm-light lamp on. The room itself is 72-75 °F (22-24 °C), quite dark, and does not experience much sound besides muffled voices from my neighbors. I will have my last meal around two hours before bed and be well-hydrated throughout the day. I will also include notes on exercise intensity and duration.
