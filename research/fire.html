<h1 id="fire">Financial Independence / Retire Early</h1>

<p>
  Financial independence / retire early (FIRE) is a relatively recent movement that promotes the concept of—you guessed it—being financially independent and being <i>able</i> to retire early, which is a natural byproduct of FI. This post discusses FIRE in its entirety: FIRE motivators, the best methods of achieving FIRE, what to do when you've made it, and others.

<h2 id="motivators">Motivators</h2>

<p>
  The average, non-FIRE person spends around:
</p>

\[(40 - 50) \frac{\text{hr}}{\text{wk}} \times 50 \frac{\text{wk}}{\text{yr}} \times 40 \frac{\text{working yr}}{\text{life}} = (80000 - 100000) \frac{\text{hr}}{\text{life}}\]

<p>
  assuming an average job of 40-50 hours per week, 2 weeks of vacation per year, and 40 working years. The hours can vary wildly (some <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/12/extreme-jobs-the-dangerous-allure-of-the-70-hour-workweek">bankers</a> can work upwards of 100 hours per week, while some lucky <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/hakj7f/my_income_has_doubled_and_i_feel_guilty_about_it/">business owners</a> only work a leisurely two hours per day), as can the vacation and number of working years.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless, the primary motivator for FIREing seems to be simply getting time back to do what you want. Cutting the number of working years by 20 saves:
</p>

\[(40 - 50) \frac{\text{hr}}{\text{wk}} \times 50 \frac{\text{wk}}{\text{yr}} \times 20 \frac{\text{working yr}}{\text{life}} = (40000 - 50000) \frac{\text{hr}}{\text{life}}\]

<p>
  Think about all that can be done with the 40,000-50,000 hours of extra time in the 40-60 age range. Traveling around the country or world; catching up on books, video games, movies, or television shows; projects around the house; seeing old friends and family; spending time with children; volunteering in the community; pursuing hobbies; riding bikes on low-traffic trails; even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lmW2tZP2kU">nothing</a> (although you don't need to FIRE for that, as Lawrence so sagely states). The list goes on and on and on. Every day is Saturday—no more having an alarm clock tell you when you <i>need</i> to get up to avoid having your boss get angry at you for being late. No more staring at the clock waiting for it to hit 5:00pm so you can leave and do things that interest you. No more waking up on Monday morning dreading the week and its meetings that happen week after week, month after month, year after year.
</p>

</figcaption>

<p>
  A sense of freedom accompanies the FI part of FIRE. Knowing you don't <i>have</i> to work is a liberating feeling and one that not many people get to experience. You can quit on your terms without fear of not being able to find another job or having to cut costs to make rent.
</p>

<p>
  Despite all of these benefits, FIRE still poses issues to some, especially in regards to relationships and purpose.
</p>

<p>
  The average American <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/234302/snapshot-americans-project-average-retirement-age.aspx">retires at the age of 66</a>. Assuming you FIRE before the age of 50, that's at least 16 years that you spend 8 hours of the day away from work friends (other activities can fill this social void, like volunteering). The main strain stems from jealousy: you are living the retirement life, while they have to continue working at a job they don't care about for the next 20 years due to either poor financial decisions or prioritizing other expenses over savings.
</p>

<p>
  Lots of people derive their life's purpose from work. When retiring early, you are depriving yourself of that purpose at least 16 years earlier than expected. This is why after FIRE plans are so important. Going from being a high-achiever at work and feeling a sense of contribution and accomplishment to doing nothing during retirement is likely to cause a major shell shock. More on this in the <a href="#post_fire">Post-FIRE</a> section.

<h2 id="fire_variants">FIRE Variants</h2>

<p>
  FIRE is both a general description of being financially independent and a specific tier in the FIRE world. Below are descriptions of the FIRE variants:
</p>

<h3 id="leanfire">LeanFIRE</h3>

<p>
  LeanFIRE is the variant for those wanting to FIRE as soon as possible. The amount of money saved is less than FIRE and significantly less than FatFIRE, but the retirement lifestyle is less lavish, decreasing retirement spending.
</p>

<h3 id="fire">FIRE</h3>

<p>
  FIRE is the standard variant. Savings are in between LeanFIRE and FatFIRE, allowing for a more comfortable retirement.
</p>

<h3 id="fatfire">FatFIRE</h3>

<p>
  FatFIRE is the high-end of FIRE. The savings are well into the millions of dollars, allowing a luxurious retirement full of travel, <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/en/restaurants">Michelin restaurants</a>, and an unmatched sense of financial security.
</p>

<p>
  FatFIRE is much less attainable than LeanFIRE or FIRE. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KwHoOnIR8Gn9gRJXPDla9Wq4QaM4euMgFQXmHvjarfA/edit#gid=0">careers of people who FatFIRE or want to FatFIRE</a> are quite similar in both position and status (manager, director, etc). Just based on the manual compilation of the Google Sheets document, being in one of the following career paths/industries is most effective, especially if management-level is achieved:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Medicine</b>: Surgery and hospital-related settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Engineering</b>: Technology and software for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">>FAANG</a> (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (Microsoft is also included)).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sales</b>: Software or technology (medical or otherwise).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Law</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_law_firms_by_revenue">Big Law</a> or corporate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Business</b>: No specific industries, but success varies wildly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Finance</b>: Banking, real estate.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="barista_fire">BaristaFIRE</h3>

<p>
  While the "Barista" part is substitutable with any part-time job—making this variant [part-time job]FIRE—it does a good job of explaining BaristaFIRE. Save enough money through full-time work that you need only to work a basic part-time job to continue living comfortably. Say your yearly spending is $40,000 and you have enough saved up to spend $30,000 per year for the rest of your life (more on how this $30,000 is calculated later). You still need $10,000 to cover your expenses, which is easily satisfied through a part-time job:
</p>

\[20 \frac{\text{hr}}{\text{wk}} \times 50 \frac{\text{wk}}{\text{yr}} \times (10-15) \frac{$}{\text{hr}} = (10000 - 15000) \frac{$}{\text{yr}}\]

<p>
  Depending on the wage, you may be able to work less ($15/hour = 13 hour/week to reach $10,000/year) or have more spending money every year.
</p>

<h3 id="coast_fire">CoastFIRE</h3>

<p>
 CoastFIRE is similar to BaristaFIRE, but instead you use your investment returns and the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">compounding interest</a> to <i>coast</i> to FIRE.
</p>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    FIRE variants and their annual spending
  </caption>
  <tr align="middle">

  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>CoastFIRE</td><td>Varies</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>BaristaFIRE</td><td>Varies</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Deciding which variant you want to achieve depends on a few things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Age</b>: When do you want to stop working?
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Lifestyle</b>: Are you frugal or extravagant in your spending?
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Future Work</b>: Do you still want to work even after you are FI or retire? You can still work while Lean/regular/FatFIREing, but it's not necessary, whereas it is for BaristaFIRE and CoastFIRE.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="fire_number">FIRE Number</h2>

<p>
  After your variant has been chosen, you need to calculate your FIRE number, the amount of money you need to retire. Once you have your FIRE number, all that's left to do is achieve it.
</p>

<p>
  One of the best FIRE calculators out there is <a href="https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/">Engaging Data's FIRE Calculator</a>. It takes into account:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Current Status</b>: Age, income, savings, spending (which shouldn't change too much with age), portfolio allotment (percentage of your portfolio in stocks, bonds, cash, all to total 100%).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Future Status</b>: Income growth, retirement spending, <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Safe_withdrawal_rates">safe withdrawal rate</a>, tax rate during retirement, and investment returns.
  </li>
</ul

<p>
  Everything is explained clearly and concisely and no math on your part is needed.
</p>

<p>
  The "Retirement Spending" field is where your chosen variant comes into play. Assuming everything is held equal with the initial values (age 32, $25,000 in current investments, etc), the following numbers are found for each variant:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <caption>
    Retirement spending vs. FIRE number
  </caption>
  <tr align="middle">
    <th>Retirement Spending ($)</th><th>FIRE Number ($)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>20,000</td><td>535,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>40,000</td><td>1,070,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>60,000</td><td>1,605,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>80,000</td><td>2,140,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>100,000</td><td>2,675,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>150,000</td><td>4,012,500</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  While retirement spending is linear with FIRE number, it is exponential with age, as shown in the following graph:
</p>

<img src="media/age_spending.png" alt="age_spending" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">
  Age as an exponential function of retirement spending (from <a href="https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/">FIRE Calculator</a> with all initial values)
</figcaption>

<p>
  This means that the longer you work, you will save exponentially more money (keeping all things the same).
</p>

<h3 id="measuring_fire_number">Measuring Your FIRE Number</h3>

<p>
  Only liquid assets should be included while measuring your FIRE number. This includes stocks, bonds, and cash (as shown in the FIRE calculator). Homes, cars, and other expensive items should <i>not</i> be included.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="investments">Investments</h2>

<p>
  There are a variety of investments you can make to increase your savings. The stock market is the most common: stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can all be purchased with the hope and expectation that they will increase in value. Private ventures can be invested in, namely businesses. While cliche, "investing in yourself" through education can yield large returns in both the short- and long-run.
</p>

<h3 id="index_funds">Index Funds</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp">Index funds</a> are one of the more popular <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp">investment vehicles</a> people use to achieve FIRE. They work by tracking a specific market index, which is a portfolio that represents a portion of a market. Indices include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a></b>: Comprised of an arbitrary set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average#Components">30 companies</a>. Not highly regarded as being representative of entire U.S. market.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index">Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500</a></b>: Comprised of the top 500 U.S. companies by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp">market capitalization</a>. Regarded as highly representative of entire U.S. market.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Russell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_1000_Index">1000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_2000_Index">2000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_3000_Index">3000</a></b>: Similar to the S&P 500, the Russell X000 is comprised of the largest X000 companies by market capitalization.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/CRSP_equity_indexes">Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)</a></b>: The CRSP index provides exposure to the entire range of companies: small-, mid-, and large-cap. This is what Vanguard's popular <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX">Total Stock Market Index Fund</a> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VTSAX/">$VTSAX</a>) is based on.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Index funds may also be available as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund">exchange-traded funds (ETF)</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>

<p>
  In 2008, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> bet $1 MM against Protégé Partners LLC that "<a href="https://fortune.com/2017/12/30/warren-buffett-million-dollar-bet/">an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over the course of 10 years</a>". Buffett won. This anecdote shows the power of index funds: simply park your money in there and let time do the rest. This takes the management and (some of) the stress out of investing.
</p>

<p>
  Index funds generally come with low expense ratios, i.e., the amount the investor pays to help cover the fund's operating expenses. For example, an expense ratio of 1% would cost the investor $1 per $100 they had invested. Vanguard offers some of the lowest expense ratios in the industry, with <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX">$VTSAX</a> offering a mere 0.04% ($4 fee for every $10,000)!
</p>

<p>
  $VTSAX average annual returns are:
</p>

<table align="center">
  <figcaption align="center">
    $VTSAX annual returns as of 31 May 2020 (note these are not <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/after_tax_return.asp">after-tax returns</a>)

  </tr>
  <tr align="middle">
    <td>Inception (Nov 2000)</td><td>6.70</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  You would be hard-pressed to find a financial manager that is able to beat these returns.
</p>

<p>
  Some funds are actively-managed, causing both expense ratios and minimum investment amounts to increase substantially. According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/when-expense-ratio-considered-high-and-when-it-considered-low.asp#:~:text=The%20average%20expense%20ratio%20for,typical%20ratio%20is%20about%200.2%25.">Investopedia</a>, "the average expense ratio for actively managed mutual funds is between 0.5% and 1.0%. They rarely exceed 2.5%." This is 12.5-25 times larger than Vanguard's 0.04%, a significant difference. These fund expenses obviously deplete raw earnings, in some cases making it worse than being in an index fund.
</p>

<p>
  Vanguard's mutual fund performances can be found <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/yearly-returns">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="401k">401(k)</h3>

<p>
  401(k) refers to the 401(k) subsection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code">Internal Revenue Code</a> (IRC, official text <a href="https://irc.bloombergtax.com/">here</a>). In essence, it's a retirement plan that receives special tax benefits. A few notes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    There is a contribution limit of $19,500 (as of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500">tax year 2020</a>). You may not contribute more than this amount in a given year.
  </li>
  <li>
    The contributions will be invested as you choose. For example, if you have a 401(k) with Vanguard, that money can be used to invest in $VTSAX. Same applies to other financial/investment firms and their respective funds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Funds from the 401(k) can only be withdrawn after the age of 59.5 with no early withdrawal penalty of 10%. If you withdraw funds any time before you reach 59.5 years old, a 10% penalty will be applied, e.g., withdrawing $10,000 at the age of 58 loses you $1,000. This is in addition to federal income tax and applicable state income tax.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/early-withdrawals-401ks">exceptions exist</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Contributions into the account are <i>not</i> taxed, meaning if you choose to put in 5% of your $1,000 paycheck, $50.00 is going in. However, withdrawals are subject to federal and state income tax, as noted in the third bullet point above. The reasons for this are multiple:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The investor is expected to be in a lower <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/">tax bracket</a> when they withdraw, giving them more back.
  </li>
  <li>
    More money is injected into the U.S. markets, which is good for everyone involved.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is an incentive for future retirees to invest in their retirement.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Some employers offer 401(k) dollar-for-dollar matching up to a certain percent of the employee's salary. For example, if a company offers up to 5% matching on your annual salary of $100,000 and you contribute 5%, or $5,000, the company will also contribute $5,000. This is essentially free money and most personal finance resources highly recommend maxing out 401(k) contributions up to the employer's maximum match. The average employer match is <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/iam/pdf/HAS2019.pdf#page=21">4.3%</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the employer match amount does <i>not</i> count towards the contribution limit. For example, if your salary is $100,000 and your employer's match is 10%, you can put in $19,500 of your money plus the $10,000 of your employer's money for a total of $29,500 into the 401(k).
</p>

<h3 id="ira">Individual Retirement Account (IRA)</h3>

<p>
  An individual retirement account (IRA) is similar to a 401(k), but has a few differences and variants.
</p>

<h4 id="traditional_ira">Traditional IRA</h4>

<p>
  Contributions into traditional IRAs are not taxed. Withdrawals (beginning at age 59.5 for no withdrawal penalty) are taxed at the owner's current income tax rate, not the tax rate they contributed at. Because the owner is likely to be in a lower tax bracket when they withdraw, this is advantageous because less tax will be paid. Contributions are also tax-deductible, meaning if you make $100,000 and contribute $6,000 to your IRA, the government will pretend you only make $94,000.
</p>

<p>
  Contribution limits are $6,000 for owners younger than 50 and $7,000 for owners older than 50.
</p>

<h4 id="roth_ira">Roth IRA</h4>

<p>
  Roth IRA contributions are taxed immediately and are <i>not</i> tax-deductible. Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, but earnings from contributions can only be withdrawn after age 59.5 for no withdrawal penalty.
</p>

<p>
  Contribution limits are $6,000 for owners younger than 50 and $7,000 for owners older than 50. However, income can prohibit some from contributing to a Roth IRA. See Schwab's table for <a href="https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits">Roth IRA contribution limits</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There is a method around the income limit, called a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp">Backdoor Roth IRA</a>. This is done by rolling traditional IRA money over into a Roth IRA account or converting the entire IRA account into a Roth IRA.
</p>

<h4 id="rollover_ira">Rollover IRA</h4>

<p>
  A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollover-ira.asp">rollover IRA</a> simply transfers the IRA funds of a former employer-sponsored account to a traditional IRA while maintaining the tax-deferred status.
</p>

<h3 id="hsa">Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>

<p>
  HSAs are used to help pay for medical costs when a person's health plan has a high <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/deductible/">deductible</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Contributions limits are $3,600 for single coverage and $7,200 for family coverage (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-20-32.pdf">IRS</a>).
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

<h3 id="spending_habits">Spending Habits</h3>

<p>
  A frugal lifestyle is most conducive to both achieving and maintaining FIRE. Finances are, in a sense, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum game</a>: what you spend you don't save and what you save you don't spend.
</p>

<p>
  Frugality can take many forms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Items: Lower-quality (value pack vs. premium chicken) or older (Xbox 360 vs. Xbox One) options may provide similar satisfaction at a reduced cost.
  </li>
  <li>
    Services: Opting to do a service yourself (changing oil, repairing sink) is much cheaper, and easier than expected—a Google or YouTube search can often yield the answers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Activities: There are many free or cheap hobbies available that require a zero or small starting costs. Going through Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies">list of hobbies</a> can provide some inspiration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abstinence: Simply don't buy what you don't need. Impulsive or unnecessary spending is a major money drain if left unchecked. Ask yourself "do I <i>really</i> need that?"
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Getting accustomed to this lifestyle is helpful in both the short- and long-term: you get to FIRE faster through more saving, and are able to more comfortably maintain FIRE when achieved.
</p>

<h3 id="marriage">Marriage</h3>

<p>
  Marriage to a working partner is arguably the most efficient way to speed up and maintain FIRE. The income the partner brings home adds to the couple's savings.
</p>

<p>
  The tax bracket will likely decrease if you file jointly. Compare the tax rate for "Single" vs. "Married, filing jointly" <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Marriage to a working partner is also not necessarily a 2x increase in spending. Expenses like housing are shared, rather than individual.
</p>

<h3 id="children">Children</h3>

<p>
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture t studies the cost of raising a child. Based on their 2015 report, <a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/crc2015_March2017.pdf"><i>Expenditures on Children By Families</i></a>, it costs a grand total of $233,610 to raise a child born in 2015 to 17 years of age. This cost varies wildly based on family and does not include the cost of higher education.
</p>

<p>
  Children are undoubtedly a hindrance to FIRE, but often provide immense joy to the parents. Besides the total cost noted above, there is little to be analyzed. The decision is up to the parents.

<h3 id="residence">Residence</h3>

<p>
  Housing is most often the largest repetitive cost in a person's life, whether it be rent or a mortgage. It also depends on how often you move or plan to move.
</p>

<h4 id="renting_vs_buying">Renting vs. Buying</h4>

<p>
  SmartAsset's <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/rent-vs-buy">rent vs. buy calculator</a> can check if it's cheaper to rent or buy over the course of a 30-year mortgage. The answer and assumptions are explained. Other costs, such as annual homeowner's insurance and home value increases, are also accounted for and can be changed.
</p>

<h4 id="living_at_home">Living at Home</h4>

<p>
  Living at home with your parents is likely the cheapest reasonable option, assuming normal living expenses (rent, utilities, etc.) are cheaper than living independently. However, this poses relationship issues with friends and romantic partners (at least in Western cultures).
</p>

<h4 id="vagabonding">Vagabonding</h4>

<p>
  Defined as:
</p>

<h2 id="post_fire">Post-FIRE</h2>

<p>
  Like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSkWrpH3H3Q">dog chasing a car</a>, it is surely strange to wake up on Monday to no alarm clock and realize you never have to go back to work. Sure, you <i>can</i>, but it's not financially required. So, what to do once you've FIREd?
</p>

<h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>

<p>
  Pursue the hobbies you never had time to work on while working 40-50 hour weeks. Some popular suggestions are (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies">full list</a>):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Gardening
  </li>
  <li>
    Video games
  </li>
  <li>
    Movies/television shows
  </li>
  <li>
    Woodworking
  </li>
  <li>
    Fitness: weightlifting, cycling, running, rock climbing, swimming
  </li>
  <li>
    Reading/writing/drawing
  </li>
  <li>
    Photography
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<p>
  While travel can be expensive with airfare, lodging, activities, and nice restaurants, the costs can be trimmed down significantly through diligent planning.
</p>

<h4 id="airfare">Airfare</h4>

<p>
  Use a service that finds cheap flights. One of the favorites is <a href="https://scottscheapflights.com/">Scott's Cheap Flights</a>, which offers a free version and <a href="https://scottscheapflights.com/premium">$49/year premium version</a>. For example, flights to east Africa (Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Entebbe) were found to be just under $600, when they are normally $1,200+!
</p>

<h4 id="lodging">Lodging</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a> is a service that connects travelers to hosts offering a free stay in their home, whether it be a bed or literal couch. It poses a couple of advantages:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    You spend little to nothing on lodging.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can meet a city native and learn more "insider information" about the city (and maybe make a friend in the process).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Other options, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostel">hostels</a> or tent camping, offer cheap or sometimes free lodging.
</p>

<h3 id="side_jobs">Side Jobs</h3>

<p>
  Working after retirement is not exclusive to one FIRE variant. A few options here (keep in mind hours are negotiable for most):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Part-time: Doctors will sometimes do a semi-retirement, in that the number of hours worked per week and responsibilities are much less.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fun: Go have a "fun" job. If you enjoy talking to people, a waiting job may be a good option. If you enjoy working on bicycles, go find a bike shop needing a mechanic. If you enjoy gardening or home improvement, go work at Lowe's or Home Depot and share the knowledge you've gained over the years.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consulting: Mostly reserved for the FatFIRE group, companies will sometimes need to bring in consultants for help. This is a perfect option that makes good money without too much time commitment.
  </li
  <li>
    Volunteering: Not a job per-se, but the work can be fun and provides a sense of purpose.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="money_saving_ideas">Money Saving Ideas</h3>

<p>
  The following can be applied in both pre- and post-FIRE: it helps to reach and maintain FIRE, respectively.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Health: Spending money on medication and other doctor visits is costly and mostly preventable. Eat a healthy diet, get sufficient sleep, keep stress low, take care of teeth, exercise multiple times a week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Diet: A subset of health, a good diet is made in both terms of quality <i>and</i> quantity. In general, people eat more than they should. Plenty of people do well on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/1500isplenty/">1500 calories a day</a>, and depending on location, good deals on quality produce can be found at supermarkets. Don't eat or drink out often.
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving: Slow(er) driving can <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/">save a decent amount of money per year</a> without driving time by too much. Safe driving decreases the probability of accidents and can lower insurance rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Entertainment: See <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used vs. New: While some items are best bought new, others can easily be rented or bought used and provide the same value. Examples include film and books.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coupons/Memberships: Using coupons or becoming a member of stores (primarily grocery-related) you frequently shop at can provide long-term savings.
  </li>
</ul>

    <blockquote>
      By a floor job, I mean something that puts a floor in how bad and desperate your life can be. As in “I won’t be unemployed forever, I can always go do X”. Or “I won’t be working at this miserable fast-food place with this boss I hate forever, I can always just do X”. A lot of this depends on just how unlucky you are – the floor for high-IQ people with savings and college degrees is quite a bit higher than the floor for less smart people with no qualifications who need something now.
