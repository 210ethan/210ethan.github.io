<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  Time is our most valuable commodity bar none. Most things can be replenished: money, our bodies, objects. Once time has passed, it is gone, never to return. It only makes sense that we want to get the best experience out of our time as possible. While time going fast is sometimes advantageous (go hold a plank for 5:00 min and tell me that you want to savor that time), slower is generally better. We never want our time with family or friends to end; we never want to leave the park during beautiful weather; we want our weekends to feel as long as possible before the dreaded Monday rears its ugly head.
</p>

<p>
  Making both short- and long-term time feel slower is arguably a major life improvement, hence this post.

<h3>Tips for a longer life</h3>

  <p>
    First, routine is the enemy of slow subjective time. It will speed up subjective time enormously. No doubt you’ve felt the feeling “where has the year gone?” and “time speeds up as you get older”.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is because of routine. Working the same job at the same place for the same hours week in and week out is what causes a year to flash by.
  </p>

<p>
  Days blend in with one another and it's difficult to tell them apart. Variety (also known as the spice of life) makes days more memorable and thus distinguishable from others.

<blockquote>
  Novelty is what slows time down, and a routine is an engine for eliminating the unexpected, thereby eliminating novelty.

<blockquote>
  Stories allow us to live an entire lifetime in the shoes of a character, but consuming the story takes only a couple of hours. Drugs can speed up or slow down mental time, psychedelics being the most notable for slowing time down (likely due to the novelty of the senses during that time). Being bored is excruciating. We will do anything for distraction. But boredom’s ability to slow down the minutes, every moment like dragging through treacle, can make an hour or day seem very long. The downside of boredom is that we’re unlikely to keep strong memories of it, unless something surprising happens.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I don't necessarily agree with the stories statement, as reading/watching generally feels short but takes a long time. Never tried psychedelics, but I know this is a common experience. Boredom is true, but I am only concerned with enjoyable time, not unenjoyable (i.e., bored) time.

<h3>Why Time Slows Down When You’re Traveling</h3>

</p>

<blockquote>
  Back in 1890, the beloved American psychologist William James wrote that “the foreshortening of the years as we grow older is due to the monotony of memory’s content.” When you’re a kid, you’re experiencing new things every hour of every day. But with the routine brought along by adulthood, the days and weeks smooth out into “contentless units,” he writes. “In youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day,” he writes. “Apprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of that time, like those of a time spent in rapid and interesting travel, are of something intricate, multitudinous and long-drawn-out.” That’s the magic of travel: being in bewildering, enchanting places awakes that childhood wonder. Immersed in novelty, you pay attention to more, and the days get longer. Life expands.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Another point for novelty, except this time it gets backed up with science. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-22048-8_5">temporal oddball effect</a> is the tendency to "overestimate the duration of rare events embedded in a stream of homogenous events" or, in other words, time feels slower when something novel happens during a routine. The novelty/routine may be long-term (working day-in-day-out and going on vacation) or short-term (in the moment something happens that is unexpected).
</p>

<p>
  And travel is a perfect example, assuming it's a place that's new. All experiences are probably firsts. First type of food, first time going there, first time seeing that, and so on. Novel stimuli everywhere for days on end.
