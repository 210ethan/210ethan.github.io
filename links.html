        Split Selves:
        <blockquote>
          At an undisclosed location outside of time, there is a version of myself who notices when I have chosen a goal that requires reliable performance over an extended period. This self then runs an integrity check and, provided the task does not seem prima facie unrealistic given our capabilities, replicates us as many times as there are days needed to complete the task. Each clone is sent to a specific day. I am one of these clones. I don't need to worry about whether I will follow through on my commitments beyond today, because that's not my job. Someone else is handling that. I am TodayMe, and if I follow through on my portion of the task, then I can trust that TomorrowMe -- who is, after all, identical -- will also do his part. And so on.
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bobbling:
        <blockquote>
          You're forking off a temporary version of yourself who ignores the passage of time and forgets all cares beyond the task at hand. As the forked self, it doesn't matter how long it takes to "spool up" and get through the "ugh field" surrounding the task, because time is meaningless inside the bobble. It takes what it takes and that's that.

        The Past, Interrupted: When distracted by the past and occupied with the present, let the present go and focus on the past. Once that is done, return to the present.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toward a More Excellent Future:
        <blockquote>
          Successful time travel is all about bringing our past, present, and future selves into a cooperative alignment. They need to trust each other. They need to communicate. Sometimes, we need to prepare things in the present and send messages into the future. Sometimes, we have to envision different futures to provide direction to the present. Sometimes, we need to honor the past.

    <a href="https://medium.com/@edabsw/a-master-plan-25dfa1ea395b">A Scalable Urban Design and the Single Building City</a>: What do future cities look like and how do they operate? The focus is on space optimization (raised streets, level rooftops for more transporation space, mass transit to pull focus away from cars) and automation of human services (delivery, firefighting). Overall good points, but actually implementing these ideas (at least the ones requiring physical changes, like raised streets) in current cities will be quite the hassle. A book on my to-read list is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42481212-future-cities"><i>Future Cities: Architecture and the Imagination</i></a> (no idea if it relates to this article).

    <blockquote>
      Let’s take all these things together: In a world where you can get cheap housing in or quite close to a massive hub of culture. A world where all shipments and returns are cheaper and faster, where you can order food from anywhere quickly for no cost, where you can travel anywhere in the city with exceptional speed. A world where all the streets have shade and no cars, there’s considerably less pollution, and the view is amazing even in the densest sections.

    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/18/sports/everest-deaths.html">Deliverance From 27,000 Feet</a>: In May 2016, three Bengali climbers died near the top of Mt. Everest. I am a firm believer that if someone can't make the climb unassisted (as in carrying all their own gear, not necessarily finding the way), they shouldn't be doing it. It puts the guides and any rescue personnel in dangerous positions, all because the climber was too proud (read: stupid) or stupid to turn around. The so-called suggestions, which should be considered commands, put in place are formed by world-class climbers: start early, retreat by 12:00pm, etc. The risk is just not worth the reward.

Is It a Crime?</a> [Warning: this article is extremely graphic and saddening.] Weingarten delves into the lives of families who have accidentally left their child in a car, resulting in their death. Sadly, safety measures have not been universally implemented due to "a powerful auto manufacturers’ lobby". The attitude of "this couldn't happen to me" prevails and surely causes many deaths. But should they be prosecuted? None of the parents showed any intent whatsoever—it was a lapse of memory while focusing on other important aspects of their life. Anything can happen to anybody (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a>) and those vulnerable should prepare for the worst. It's not acknowledging poor X skills, it's admitting human nature and bad luck sometimes combine in potent combinations and you're doing the best you can to mitigate that. [!culture]

    <a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">How Not to Talk to Your Kids</a>: Being praised for being "smart" doesn't necessarily help. Bronson reviews literature that discusses this idea, and gives examples of other children, including their own, that have both suffered and improved with different types of praise. A few takeaways: 1) Effort should be praised, as intelligence generally follows effort (my studying hard for an exam will increase my knowledge for that exam), but not vice versa. 2) Be specific in praise. Saying "great job!" is ambiguous and doesn't give the child a certain behavior to continue. Instead, saying "great job figuring out why that first approach on your math homework didn't work!" is much better. 3) Let kids fail. Some people I knew in high school who never failed did very poorly on their first exam in university, resulting in tears and a self-existential crisis never before seen. What's important is learning from failure (how, why) and learning how to recover from it. [!psychology]

The author provides a "Nutshell" summary, then begins quoting various studies supporting each point. Money, work satisfaction, materialism and purchasing, interpersonal relationships, and appreciation and how they relate to happiness are all discussed. Some of my favorite points: "Don’t be stingy. It's bad for your health.", "Set goals that are reasonably challenging and reasonably achievable.", "Prefer experiential purchases; avoid materialistic goals.", "Associate with happy people.", "Go for smaller, more frequent successes rather than larger ones.".

Depression obviously has roots in brain chemistry and all that, but exercise and socialization helps mitigate the negatives. Sadness is often brought on by the person themself.

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22662107">Incentives in publication and online comments</a>: "Why make one 10x effort paper when you will serve your interests much better and with lower risks making 10 1x effort papers?" After all, the 10 1x papers will still be accepted and people will likely enjoy the work, while the one 10x paper will only have a marginally-greater impact, i.e., people won't notice you put in 10x the effort. PhD students often have publication requirements set by their professor: publish X papers and I'll let you graduate. While this is one measure of progress, it fails to include quality in that measure. One of my professors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Dougherty">Dr. Edward Dougherty</a>, is a big advocate of good science. I once heard him freely describe a student's paper as "steaming garbage" (or something to that effect). He believes to put out a truly decent paper on cancer takes many years, not the 1-2 that most papers nowadays get finished in. And yet those who produce more papers are viewed as higher value to potential employers, academia or industry. The current structure of publication incentive should change. I'm not sure to what or how to go about doing so, but the amount of poor papers published in poor journals with poor reviewers only discourages quality science from happening. (All this is not to say that all papers which are produced in a short time period are poor.)
