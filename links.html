        <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy">How to Be Happy</a>: Discusses what correlates with happiness (physical attractiveness doesn't very much, while relationship and work satisfaction do), as well as concrete methods for becoming happier.

The author provides a "Nutshell" summary, then begins quoting various studies supporting each point. Money, work satisfaction, materialism and purchasing, interpersonal relationships, and appreciation and how they relate to happiness are all discussed. Some of my favorite points: "Don’t be stingy. It's bad for your health.", "Set goals that are reasonably challenging and reasonably achievable.", "Prefer experiential purchases; avoid materialistic goals.", "Associate with happy people.", "Go for smaller, more frequent successes rather than larger ones.".

I would stay late and go in on weekends to help students with issues. I was soon feeling occasionally burnt out, but it fluctuated.

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22662107">Incentives in publication and online comments</a>: "Why make one 10x effort paper when you will serve your interests much better and with lower risks making 10 1x effort papers?" After all, the 10 1x papers will still be accepted and people will likely enjoy the work, while the one 10x paper will only have a marginally-greater impact, i.e., people won't notice you put in 10x the effort. PhD students often have publication requirements set by their professor: publish X papers and I'll let you graduate. While this is one measure of progress, it fails to include quality in that measure. One of my professors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Dougherty">Dr. Edward Dougherty</a>, is a big advocate of good science. I once heard him freely describe a student's paper as "steaming garbage" (or something to that effect). He believes to put out a truly decent paper on cancer takes many years, not the 1-2 that most papers nowadays get finished in. And yet those who produce more papers are viewed as higher value to potential employers, academia or industry. The current structure of publication incentive should change. I'm not sure to what or how to go about doing so, but the amount of poor papers published in poor journals with poor reviewers only discourages quality science from happening. (All this is not to say that all papers which are produced in a short time period are poor.)
