  This is a place for me to archive links I read. My posting a link here does NOT endorse or "thumbs-up" that link. I may vehemently disagree with it, but still want to archive it for future reference.

  I find my links a variety of ways, with Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia being the primary sources. I go down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole">website rabbit holes</a>. For example, someone posted <a href="https://davidklaing.com/links-sublime-introductory-lectures/">sublime introductory lectures</a> on Reddit. I then looked through the site and found the <a href="https://davidklaing.com/yearly-retrospectives/">yearly retrospectives</a>, where I then found <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/one-touch-to-inbox-zero/">One-Touch to Inbox Zero</a>, and even more on that page. I use a similar method for understanding new science or technology. If there is a term I don't understand, I follow it down a rabbit hole until I understand the base level of that component, then work my way back up to the original term and continue from there.

      Sport is nothing, if not a gateway to physical and psychological possibility. All one needs is the courage to push the boat way out: the deeper and rougher the water the better.

That said at the deepest level she is still in the public eye, the “athlete thing” is an experience, and whether a blessing or an inconvenience she handles her role positively. At its heart, the energy she expresses with her vineyard and the process by which she learned to grow, harvest, and bottle her own wine is the same energy you may see her sink into the winning stride of a silly fitness competition: it was effort, toil, and joy, and whether she loses or tastes a blended red that exceeds her expectations, her eyes crease and her smile requires no explanation.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Several investigators observed that short naps of less than 30 min duration had an invigorating effect, helped to maintain daytime arousal levels and enhanced performance...Moreover, short daytime naps were also reported to improve the emotional state. Even habitual nappers have been reported to benefit from naps
      </p>
      <p>
        Naps of less than 10 min duration have few if any benefit, whereas naps of between 10 and 45 min have restorative effects that last throughout the rest of the day...The body and mind thus need to be trained to take short naps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The optimum time for a nap is in the afternoon around 15:00 hours [3:00pm]. Daytime naps during the afternoon may have a biological basis, as daytime arousal levels have been shown to decline around this time
      </p>
      <p>
        Daytime naps are associated with sleep inertia after the patient awakens. Sleep inertia results in impaired alertness and performance for approximately 30 min after awakening from a nap, and slows the speed of cognitive tasks, but has few effects on the accuracy of task performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another concern about daytime naps is that they could diminish the quality of subsequent sleep at night [23,24]; however, there is little evidence to support this concern. Most investigators have not found daytime naps to affect nighttime sleep adversely.

    <blockquote>
      Unlike morphine which takes 15 to 20 minutes to relieve pain, the lollipop is effective within five minutes. It’s also much easier to administer than morphine, which must be injected into a large muscle, and if the dosage is too strong the lollipop can be rapidly removed. The effects of morphine cannot be halted.

    <blockquote>
      First, an independent lab should store blood and urine samples from all major league players annually and test these samples (using the latest detection techniques) at 10-, 20- and 30-year intervals following each player's retirement. Second, all players should be paid over a 30-year period. Third, if any player's blood tests positive for performance enhancing drugs, that player will forfeit his remaining salary and pension and will be banned from baseball for life.
    </blockquote>
    I especially like last part and have advocated (amongst my friends) for this to be implemented in track and cycling, along with forfeiture of their sponsorships. These athletes' livelihood is dependent on their participating in major events. The risk of this being rescinded is significantly greater than the "risk" of not using PEDs and performing poorly. Sadly, I think PEDs increase the excitement of events, as the athletes are playing at higher levels. [!culture]

      There was an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them, and a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued. Police used more than ten thousand rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound (0.5 kg) bombs (which the police referred to as "entry devices") made of FBI-supplied Tovex, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The ensuing fire killed eleven of the people in the house (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13). The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately sixty-five nearby houses. Although firefighters had earlier drenched the building prior to the bombing, after the fire broke out, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, so held them back.

      The eye is not a single frame snapshot camera. It is more like a video stream. The eye moves rapidly in small angular amounts and continually updates the image in one's brain to "paint" the detail. We also have two eyes, and our brains combine the signals to increase the resolution further. We also typically move our eyes around the scene to gather more information. Because of these factors, the eye plus brain assembles a higher resolution image than possible with the number of photoreceptors in the retina. So the megapixel equivalent numbers below refer to the spatial detail in an image that would be required to show what the human eye could see when you view a scene.

      Standards are set to help raise people up. To inspire. To push. Standards aren’t lowered just so folks can brag about hitting them. If it could be done easily you wouldn’t bother trying. If everyone achieves it easily they must be doing it wrong. Or the standard must be changed. How do so many end up on the bad, self-defeating side of ego?

      So I say, “Why don't you try to get good at something?” Pick one thing and do it to the exclusion of other things. Develop it. Progress. Rise. By doing so you will reach a height from which you may observe what you have left behind, what you sacrificed in order to achieve. Being good at the one thing clearly exposes the difference between what you can do well and what you can’t. Weaknesses become obvious. The focus of future work is clear. But only IF fixing those deficiencies will take you closer to your goal.

        Novelty makes the human brain pay attention. Something novel is something potentially life-changing, in both good and bad ways. Full focus, aliveness to the present moment and unusually clear memory all kick in when paying attention to something novel.

      What aspects of your situation are truly fixed, and which can you change? Altering your perspective can buffer the negative impact of even the inflexible aspects. If exhaustion is a key problem, ask yourself which tasks—including critical ones—you could delegate to free up meaningful time and energy for other important work. Are there ways to reshape your job in order to gain more control or to focus on the most fulfilling tasks?

      Reduce exposure to job stressors. You’ll also need to target high-value activities and relationships that still trigger unhealthy stress. This involves resetting the expectations of colleagues, clients, and even family members for what and how much you’re willing to take on, as well as ground rules for working together. You may get pushback. But doubters must know that you’re making these changes to improve your long-term productivity and protect your health.

Coaching done well may be the most effective intervention designed for human performance. Yet the allegiance of coaches is to the people they work with; their success depends on it. And the existence of a coach requires an acknowledgment that even expert practitioners have significant room for improvement. Are we ready to confront this fact when we’re in their care?

      There is also lots of anecdotal support for the large variation between programmers. During the time I was at Boeing in the mid 1980s, there was a project that had about 80 programmers working on it that was at risk of missing a critical deadline. The project was critical to Boeing, and so they moved most of the 80 people off that project and brought in one guy who finished all the coding and delivered the software on time. I didn’t work on that project, and I didn’t know the guy, so I’m not 100% sure the story is even true. But I heard the story from someone I trusted, and it seemed true at the time.

Structured homeschool had the best results, while unstructured had the worst. The involvement and role of the parents plays a significant role. I find this easy to believe based on my experience with homeschooled students. I know three boys whose father is a university professor and department chair of a well-known private university. All three of his kids are well-behaved, intelligent, and high-achieving. On the other spectrum, I know other homeschooled students whose skills aren't nearly as strong as the three boys. What some don't consider is the social learning that takes place in public school. Students are exposed to a wide variety of backgrounds in public school (provided they live in a relatively diverse area). This is challenging to replicate in a homeschool setting. Co-ops are an option, but it is unlikely the same amount of diversity would be achieved. [!culture, !psychology]

    <blockquote>
      the future of ambition is one in which millions of brilliant people globally, historically excluded from the global economy, have the opportunity and incentive to harness ever more powerful technologies to solve some of our species’ and our planet’s most important problems. Impressive progress in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology gives ambitious individuals the tools – again, at falling capital cost – to build products and services that we can scarcely imagine today.

This self then runs an integrity check and, provided the task does not seem prima facie unrealistic given our capabilities, replicates us as many times as there are days needed to complete the task. Each clone is sent to a specific day. I am one of these clones. I don't need to worry about whether I will follow through on my commitments beyond today, because that's not my job. Someone else is handling that. I am TodayMe, and if I follow through on my portion of the task, then I can trust that TomorrowMe -- who is, after all, identical -- will also do his part. And so on.

Sadly, safety measures have not been universally implemented due to "a powerful auto manufacturers’ lobby". The attitude of "this couldn't happen to me" prevails and surely causes many deaths. But should they be prosecuted? None of the parents showed any intent whatsoever—it was a lapse of memory while focusing on other important aspects of their life.

    <a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">How Not to Talk to Your Kids</a>: Being praised for being "smart" doesn't necessarily help. Bronson reviews literature that discusses this idea, and gives examples of other children, including their own, that have both suffered and improved with different types of praise. A few takeaways: 1) Effort should be praised, as intelligence generally follows effort (my studying hard for an exam will increase my knowledge for that exam), but not vice versa. 2) Be specific in praise. Saying "great job!" is ambiguous and doesn't give the child a certain behavior to continue. Instead, saying "great job figuring out why that first approach on your math homework didn't work!" is much better. 3) Let kids fail. Some people I knew in high school who never failed did very poorly on their first exam in university, resulting in tears and a self-existential crisis never before seen. What's important is learning from failure (how, why) and learning how to recover from it. [!psychology]

The author provides a "Nutshell" summary, then begins quoting various studies supporting each point. Money, work satisfaction, materialism and purchasing, interpersonal relationships, and appreciation and how they relate to happiness are all discussed. Some of my favorite points: "Don’t be stingy. It's bad for your health.", "Set goals that are reasonably challenging and reasonably achievable.", "Prefer experiential purchases; avoid materialistic goals.", "Associate with happy people.", "Go for smaller, more frequent successes rather than larger ones.".

Depression obviously has roots in brain chemistry and all that, but exercise and socialization helps mitigate the negatives. Sadness is often brought on by the person themself.

I would stay late and go in on weekends to help students with issues. I was soon feeling occasionally burnt out, but it fluctuated.

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22662107">Incentives in publication and online comments</a>: "Why make one 10x effort paper when you will serve your interests much better and with lower risks making 10 1x effort papers?" After all, the 10 1x papers will still be accepted and people will likely enjoy the work, while the one 10x paper will only have a marginally-greater impact, i.e., people won't notice you put in 10x the effort. PhD students often have publication requirements set by their professor: publish X papers and I'll let you graduate. While this is one measure of progress, it fails to include quality in that measure. One of my professors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Dougherty">Dr. Edward Dougherty</a>, is a big advocate of good science. I once heard him freely describe a student's paper as "steaming garbage" (or something to that effect). He believes to put out a truly decent paper on cancer takes many years, not the 1-2 that most papers nowadays get finished in. And yet those who produce more papers are viewed as higher value to potential employers, academia or industry. The current structure of publication incentive should change. I'm not sure to what or how to go about doing so, but the amount of poor papers published in poor journals with poor reviewers only discourages quality science from happening. (All this is not to say that all papers which are produced in a short time period are poor.)
