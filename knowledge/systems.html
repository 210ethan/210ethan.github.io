<h1 id="systems">Productivity System Testing</h1>

<p>
  I review and experiment with productivity systems in hopes of finding one that improves <a href="productivity.html">my own system</a>. Each entry is organized as follows (as applicable):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info (as applicable): Title, author, link, experiment timeframe, see also.
  </li>
  <li>
    Summary: High-level overview of the system, highlights, and any notes (or link to notes) that I took.
  </li>
  <li>
    Methods: How I plan to implement it into my life, any additions/subtractions/modifications to the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Results: How it worked for me. Each system may have different metrics, both objective and subjective.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoughts: What I think of the system, what I would change, recommendations, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My productivity philosophy is simple: take what works, discard what doesn't, and don't try too hard to force anything to work. This is my attempt to see what works for me in these systems. The timeframes range from 1-60 days, which isn't trying too hard to force anything to work. If something <i>really</i> isn't working for me, I'll stop when I recognize that.

<h2 id="alone">Working Alone</h2>

<h3>Info</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Timeframe: 11 June 2022 - 15 June 2022
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  (I'm actually writing this report despite not planning this experiment.)
</p>

<p>
  I am often distracted at work because of how good of friends I am with people. I play and joke around very often with others, occasionally talking about work-related topics. I've noticed this is a drain on my productivity—while I am at work for 10 hours or so, I rarely work for 10 hours. This leaves me with two options:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Become worse friends with coworkers
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce time spent with coworkers and increase time spent alone
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  For obvious reasons, I chose the latter.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
  I will work later than usual to minimize my interactions with coworkers.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  This worked surprisingly well and I am happy with the results, although I'm not sure I'm able to decouple my increased productivity with the exciting work I was doing. I worked until 12:00am on Monday and Tuesday (dinner from 5:30-8:30pm), 11:00pm on Wednesday (dinner from 6:00-8:30pm), 4:00pm on Thursday, 5:00pm on Friday, and for three hours on Sunday (in an empty office). In total, around 55-60 hours. I estimate 20 of those hours were alone.
</p>

<p>
  And I thrived. I cranked out emails and to-dos that had been sitting untouched for a while. There was no itch to socialize or joke around—I was focused and diligent in knocking out work. I looked good to my manager and coworkers for staying late to knock out items.
</p>

<p>
  The downsides were not insignificant. My sleep suffered: throughout the week I got 6 (Sunday), 7, 4, 5, and 7 (Thursday) hours of sleep. My training suffered: I got a couple of bike sessions in but very little strength training. My social life wasn't horrible: I went out to nice dinners with friends twice before heading back into work to finish some stuff up. My hobbies suffered: I didn't touch this website, journal, and read very little. Part of the issue is my expectation of being at work at 7:00am for the daily priorities meeting (and morning meetings taking place). If I could get by this, I'd exercise and do personal stuff in the morning and work from 11:00am-8:00pm, giving me a solid three hours of alone time to crank through what I need to. One other downside is the expectation it could set for myself: if someone leaves at 7:00pm every night and leaves at 5:00pm one day, they just left two hours early. While I don't think my manager is like this, there is always the chance it could turn out like that.
</p>

<p>
  But this isn't feasible, so other solutions will have to be formed. A few ideas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Get noise-cancelling headphones. While I listen to music using my Apple EarPods (not AirPods), they do a poor job of eliminating noise from around my cube. I hear other conversations and get distracted by them. Perhaps cancelling noise will improve my focus.
  </li>
  <li>
    Going home in the middle of the day to exercise/do personal tasks for lunch is impractical. It's a 20-min drive and just not worth it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Going in early is a bit more acceptable, albeit more difficult socially, considering things that happen after work will require a drive back to the area (so equivalent of the above item).
  </li>
  <li>
    Displacing myself from my cube helps with distractions, but decreases productivity due to lack of a <a href="improvements.html#additional_monitor">second monitor</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The solution remains undecided for now, but I'll likely continue to work late for the productivity benefits it provides.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  The Pomodoro technique is simple: set a timer for 25:00 min to work on a single task and nothing else whatsoever. After the 25:00 min is up, take a 5:00 min break. Rinse and repeat. After every fourth cycle, take a longer 15:00-30:00 min break.
</p>

<p>
  Comments from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4iLk2rxTguFqHHs3Y/the-power-of-pomodoros">The Power of Pomodoros</a> (unformatted for simplicity):
</p>

<blockquote>
  What you do during the break matters a lot. It should be rewarding and energizing or relaxing. Anyway, I've had success reducing an Ugh Field (around studying) by celebrating like a madman when the timer ended and then doing a few dishes (which I usually abhor, but is both relaxing and rewarding as a break). Once the Ughly Beast was down on its knees, I was able to abandon the timer and go over 25 minutes and I have been kicking its ass ever since. Some suggestions for break activities: dancing, jumping, throwing air punches; playing with a musical instrument; scribbling on a piece of paper; small housekeeping tasks. Avoid: browsing, esp. reddit; anything that can't be interrupted instantly e.g. reading or watching a video; anything that may cause an interruption later on or will occupy your mind e.g. beginning to cook; reddit
</blockquote>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
  I will use Pomodoros over the course of two workweeks.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Total: 7 cycles. Started with 25-5 cycles, but increased it to 40-5 after 25:00 minutes wasn't enough and I was starting to get into the flow. Definitely helps to "gamify" work, and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-keeper-time-management/id867374917">app</a> I use keeps track of total number of cycles performed per day (and graphs them over the course of time). Cut a few short/long due to other stuff. Overall, around 8:00 hours of focused work today, more than I normally complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 4 cycles. Continued with 40-5 cycles today, but even those are a bit too short at times. Will update to 50-10 cycles beginning tomorrow. Worked much longer not on cycles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 2 cycles. 50-10 worked well. Work periods allow flow and breaks feel fairly long. I will stick with this, if not decrease the break a bit. Worked much longer not on cycles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 0 cycles. Didn't do any cycles today—the work I was doing just didn't call for it and I was regularly interrupted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 0 cycles. Didn't do any cycles today—the work I was doing just didn't call for it and I was regularly interrupted.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    Total: 6 cycles. Worked well today, although a few times where I went over due to work priorities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 7 cycles. Updated cycle to 53-7, as 50-10 was a bit long break-wise, but I still wanted to keep it at an hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 5 cycles. Found that listening to music is fine for mundane, mindless tasks, but shouldn't be used during more intense ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 0 cycles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Total: 0 cycles.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    25-5 cycles are probably too short for any meaningful work to get done and the break too short to get any real relaxation. Longer cycles of (50-80)-(10-20) are likely more efficient: longer work periods allow work to "flow" for longer and longer breaks allow more relaxation.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's important that the work portion of cycles are devoted strictly to work and nothing else.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pomodoros are really only effective on solitary work tasks.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I will continue using 53-7 cycles during tasks in which I have to do for an extended period of time. In any other circumstances, I will work as I see fit.

    Title: 120-Hour Workweek: <a href="https://blog.nickwinter.net/posts/the-120-hour-workweek-epic-coding-time-lapse">https://blog.nickwinter.net/posts/the-120-hour-workweek-epic-coding-time-lapse</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Author: Nick Winter
  </li>
  <li>
    Timeframe:
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  Winter spends 120.75 hours over the course of a single week coding for personal project (job?). He makes many observations along the way, ranging from "Viking metal is stronger than sleep" to "I speed up the longer I go".
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
  I will work six 12-hour days, totaling 72 hours for that week. A far shot from Winter's 120 hours, but significantly more than the normal 40 I work. These days will be roughly split up as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Personal: 4:30-7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    Work: 7:00am-12:00pm (5)
  </li>
  <li>
    Break: 12:00-12:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Work: 12:30-6:00pm (5.5)
  </li>
  <li>
    Break: 6:00-7:00pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Work: 7:00-8:30pm (1.5)
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal: 8:30pm-bedtime
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
  A few thoughts and expectations I have before starting this test:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I may run out of things to work on. If this happens, I will call it off for that day. There's no point in staying at work to do nothing.
  </li>
  <li>
    I expect to see how much a role eating lunch plays in my productivity. I generally don't eat during the day, leaving me feeling lethargic at the end of the day. I will track what I have for lunch and how I feel towards the end of the day.
  </li>
  <li>
    My job satisfaction is proportional to how busy I am: if there is a lot to do and work on, I am much happier, whereas sitting at my desk twiddling my thumbs leads to an existential crisis of why I'm working here and how am I going to do so for the next 15 years. The proportion is on a percentage scale rather than an absolute scale, i.e., I experience approximately the same amount of satisfaction in working 8 vs. 12 hr if I'm busy the 100% of the time.
  </li>
</ul>

    Title: Time Well Spent: <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Author: Jacob Falkovich
  </li>
  <li>
    Timeframe:
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  Falkovich tracks his days hour-by-hour and assigns specific values to the hour according to the activity:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    -2 points for each half an hour spent at a screen (TV/internet) after midnight, or awake for any reason after 1 am.
  </p>
  <p>
    0 points for filler activities, like sleep, commute or reading blogs. I’m sorry, you’re not earning any credit right now.
  </p>
  <p>
    1 point for reading books and walking, two things that are positive but I’d do them anyway. Reading and walking are what I do on vacation.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 points for things that are important but that I would do anyway because of outside pressure (my actual job, cooking) or because I love doing them (time with my fiancee and friends, playing sports).
  </p>
  <p>
    3 points for important activities whose benefits are too long-term to be immediately motivating: gym, self-study, blogging.
  </p>
  <p>
    And 4 points for each half hour doing something that primarily benefits others, like volunteering or helping a friend in need.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Hours are summed, allowing review of day-to-day and week-to-week differences.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
  My points will be assigned as follows (rationale and considerations included) with a resolution of 1 hr:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    -2 points: Every 30 min spent at a screen after 9:00pm, if I'm awake for any reason after 10:00pm, and for every 30 min of sleep below 6:00 hr. Exceptions to this include if I am socializing or having to work.
  </li>
  <li>
    -1 point: Every 15 min over 77 min spent on "Entertainment" content. I use <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> to track my computer time and <a href="http://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocusd</a> to limit time spent on unproductive websites. I allow myself 77 min/day (9 hr/week) on Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, and a few others. On occasion I will bypass it via an incognito Chrome browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    0 points: Commuting, hygiene, chores, laundry, cooking, sleep. These are required and non-productive tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    1 point: Reading books/internet links and spending time with friends (virtual or in-person). Like Jacob, I would do this anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    2 points: Work, exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    3 points: Writing for this website.
  </li>
</ul>
