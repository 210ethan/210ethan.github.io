<h1 id="systems">Productivity System Testing</h1>

<p>
  I review and experiment with productivity systems in hopes of finding one that improves <a href="../productivity/productivity.html">my own system</a>. Each entry is organized as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Info: Title, author, link, experiment timeframe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Summary: High-level overview of the system, highlights, and any notes (or link to notes) that I took.
  </li>
  <li>
    Methods: How I plan to implement it into my life, any additions/subtractions/modifications to the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Results: How it worked for me. Each system may have different metrics, both objective and subjective.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoughts: What I think of the system, what I would change, recommendations, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My productivity philosophy is simple: take what works, discard what doesn't, and don't try too hard to force anything to work. This is my attempt to see what works for me in these systems. The timeframes range from 30-60 days, which isn't trying too hard to force anything to work. If something <i>really</i> isn't working for me, I'll stop when I recognize that.

<h3>Info</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Title: Time Well Spent: <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Author: Jacob Falkovich
  </li>
  <li>
    Timeframe: 01 February 2021 - 02 March 2021 (30 days)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  Jacob tracks his days hour-by-hour and assigns specific values to the hour according to the activity:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    -2 points for each half an hour spent at a screen (TV/internet) after midnight, or awake for any reason after 1 am.
  </p>
  <p>
    0 points for filler activities, like sleep, commute or reading blogs. I’m sorry, you’re not earning any credit right now.
  </p>
  <p>
    1 point for reading books and walking, two things that are positive but I’d do them anyway. Reading and walking are what I do on vacation.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 points for things that are important but that I would do anyway because of outside pressure (my actual job, cooking) or because I love doing them (time with my fiancee and friends, playing sports).
  </p>
  <p>
    3 points for important activities whose benefits are too long-term to be immediately motivating: gym, self-study, blogging.
  </p>
  <p>
    And 4 points for each half hour doing something that primarily benefits others, like volunteering or helping a friend in need.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Hours are summed, allowing review of day-to-day and week-to-week differences.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
  My points will be assigned as follows (rationale and considerations included) with a resolution of 1 hr:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    -2 points: Every 30 min spent at a screen after 9:00pm, if I'm awake for any reason after 10:00pm, and for every 30 min of sleep below 6:00 hr. Exceptions to this include if I am socializing or having to work.
  </li>
  <li>
    -1 point: Every 15 min over 77 min spent on "Entertainment" content. I use <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> to track my computer time and <a href="http://www.stayfocusd.com/">StayFocusd</a> to limit time spent on unproductive websites. I allow myself 77 min/day (9 hr/week) on Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, and a few others. On occasion I will bypass it via an incognito Chrome browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    0 points: Commuting, hygiene, chores, laundry, cooking, sleep. These are required and non-productive tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    1 point: Reading books/internet links and spending time with friends (virtual or in-person). Like Jacob, I would do this anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    2 points: Work, exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    3 points: Writing for this website.
  </li>
</ul>

  Conditional formatting was used to color the cells based on value and give a more visual representation of how I'm doing.
