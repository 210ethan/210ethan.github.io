<p>
  <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong Spaced Repetition Wiki</a> provides all the information you can ever want or need about spaced repetition. Includes the science, blog posts, and various decks, among other items.

<h2 id="why_srs">Why Use SRS?</h2>

<p>
  You can remember virtually <i>anything</i> using SRS and with minimal effort. To put it in perspective, I've learned and remembered the following: all countries and their capitals, flags and locations; all elements and their symbols, atomic numbers, and atomic masses; poems. This is not a complete list.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last year, I've spent an average of 8.3 min/day studying those cards. Less than 10 min/day to learn all of that information. Of course, you can be more or less aggressive with the number of new cards introduced per day.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<p>
  Below you can find a list of information suggestions. I include information based on a few factors:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Is this useful for me to know?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is this interesting for me to know?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do I forget this often?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I keep a record of everything I would like to add throughout the week, then during my weekly review/planning, I add all the information to Anki.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Geography: Countries, country capitals, country flags; states, state capitals, state flags; mountains, mountain ranges; oceans, seas, rivers, lakes; regions
  </li>
  <li>
    Chemistry: Element symbols, element names, atomic numbers, atomic masses; group names; bonds, molecular structures
  </li>
  <li>
    Poems: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">Invictus</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46550/the-new-colossus">New Colossus</a>, <a href="https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night">Do not go gentle into that good night</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56736/1-january-1965">1 January 1965</a>. (I've found that when learning poems, everyday practice is best. When maintaining the learning, spaced repetition is sufficient.)

<h2 id="alternating_days">Alternating Days</h2>

<p>
  I fell out of my daily Anki routine for some time, but seemed to notice that I got better results when I alternated review days. To test this, I spent three weeks with each method: every day vs. every other day. I noted how many cards I had due that day and how many I missed. No new cards included in the statistics.
</p>

<img src="media/srs/alternating_days.png" alt="alternating_days" class="center">

<p>
  Average missed percentages come out to 5.43% for every day and 7.69% for alternating days.
</p>

<p>
  A few reflections/notes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    I should have noted down the total time each session took.
  </li>
  <li>
    I do not feel like the three-week trial period for both types of practice was enough. More time spent with each type of practice will give better results, but for now I will stick with practicing every day.
  </li>
  <li>
    I could not find any literature or other experiences with spaced spaced repetition, i.e., waiting two or more days before reviewing again.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="memorization">Memorization</h2>

<p>
  As of 11 July 2021, I have stopped learning and using the major system to focus on other projects.
</p>

<p>
  I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system">major system</a> and Anki for memorizing long numbers.
</p>

<img src="media/srs/major_system.png" alt="major_system" class="center">

<p>
  Two helpful Anki decks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1076709077">Major System (Trainer, IPA, with audio)</a>: Sounds associated with numbers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1189825176">Major System pictures</a>: Cards with pictures and associated numbers, e.g., file = 85. There is something to be said about creating flashcards yourself: Gabriel Wyner (author of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19661852-fluent-forever">Fluent Forever</a>) claims it is important that <i>you</i> make your own language-learning Anki cards, as you learn them along the way and they're your own. Edit this deck's pictures as needed.
