<h2 id="queens_gambit">The Queen's Gambit</h2>

<p>
  Info: Available on Netflix, it's 8 episodes long and was released on 23 October 2020. Originally a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62022.The_Queen_s_Gambit">novel</a> by Walter Tevis.
</p>

<p>
  Taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, <i>The Queen's Gambit</i> follows the rise of Beth Harmon through the ranks of the chess world, beginning with matches against her orphanage's janitor in the basement and culminating in defeating the world champion Borgov in Moscow (during the Cold War, mind you!).
</p>

<p>
  Chess is only one theme among many. Harmon goes through her life without biological parents, getting adopted by a manipulative mother and a father who leaves soon thereafter, a few friends, one of whom is from the orphanage and the others through chess. She struggles with addiction to alcohol and anti-anxiety medication (librium) that she became dependent on at the orphanage. She first feels love and eventually has emotionless one-night stands with friends. She is subject to the bright spotlight that world-class chess players experience, in addition to an even brighter one due to her being a world-class <i>female</i> chess player.
</p>

<p>
  I see a few parallels between the chess board and Harmon's loneliness in life. In chess, you and your pieces are all alone—no one else can help and all moves directly help or hurt your cause. This principle can be applied to some people's lives: they are all alone (no parents or others to help them) and all decisions improve or worsen their lives. Harmon had no one to blame for her wins or losses, in both chess and life. She chose to take the librium regularly (this is arguable, as she was a young child and addiction to a feeling like that is a powerful thing), she chose alcohol and benders over continuing to play, etc. On the flip side, there are some things in both you can't control: your opponent's moves and other's moves, respectively. In her first match against Watts, she is ill-prepared and experiences her first loss ever. Yet there is little to nothing she could have done. Sure, more preparation would do <i>some</i> good, but part of chess is knowing how to respond to certain setups and moves, resulting in sometimes losing due to holes in your knowledge. The important aspect is learning from the loss and applying those lessons into preparation for future games, a principle that can easily be applied to life in general: lose &#8594; learn &#8594; apply &#8594; lose &#8594; ... &#8594; win. Rinse and repeat as needed for specific applications and until you stop losing.

<p>
  In regards to reception, quite a few high-profile players have supported the series. Chess.com even released a <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/play-beth-harmon">Beth Harmon bot</a>, allowing challengers to play her at ages 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 20, 22, all with their respective ratings.
</p>

<p>
  The acting is good on all fronts.
