<p>
  Taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, <i>The Queen's Gambit</i> follows the rise of Beth Harmon through the ranks of the chess world, beginning with matches against her orphanage's janitor in the basement and culminating in defeating the world champion Borgov in Moscow (during the Cold War, mind you!). Throughout, Harmon struggles with addiction to alcohol and anti-anxiety medication (librium) that she became dependent on at the orphanage.
