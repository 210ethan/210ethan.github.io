<h1 id="notes2">Notes 2: Economics, Medicine, (Geo)politics, Technology</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to take notes and write thoughts on economics, medicine, (geo)politics, and technology.
</p>

<p>
  The process of learning about these items follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a> algorithm, often using Wikipedia as the root node and following the search across a multitude of websites.
</p>

<p>
  Blockquotes (see below for example) are essentially direct quotes. For example, if the quote says "In our lives, we are constantly ...", I will shorten it to "We are constantly ...". No information is lost, but the note is shorter for reference and typing. Anything in [square brackets like this] is my personal note.

<h3 id="economics_taxes">Taxes</h3>

<p>
  Taxes affect the economy in both the short- and long-term (from Tax Policy Center's <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-economy-short-run">briefing book</a>). First, the short-term.
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] primarily through their impact on demand. Tax cuts boost demand by increasing disposable income and by encouraging businesses to hire and invest more. Tax increases do the reverse. These demand effects can be substantial when the economy is weak but smaller when it is operating near capacity.
</blockquote>

<p>
  This can be quantified using the so-called "output multiplier":
</p>

<blockquote>
  How much tax cuts boost demand (or tax hikes restrain it) depends on the sensitivity of household and business behavior—for example, how households divide increased after-tax income between consumption and saving, and whether businesses choose to hire and invest more. Economists summarize these effects in a simple measure, the output multiplier, expressing how many dollars of increased economic activity result from a dollar reduction in taxes or a dollar increase in government spending.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In general, tax cuts do <i>not</i> help as much as spending increases do:
</p>

<blockquote>
  CBO’s estimates suggest that, dollar for dollar, tax cuts are often a less effective means of stimulus than are spending increases. If the federal government purchases goods and services itself (or helps state and local governments do so), most or all of the spending will boost demand. If the government cuts personal taxes, however, a substantial amount of the added spending power leaks into saving.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now, the long-term:
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] Primarily through the supply side. High marginal tax rates can discourage work, saving, investment, and innovation, while specific tax preferences can affect the allocation of economic resources. But tax cuts can also slow long-run economic growth by increasing deficits. The long-run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also their deficit effects.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<blockquote>
  taxes can affect both supply and demand factors. Reducing marginal tax rates on wages and salaries, for example, can induce people to work more. Expanding the earned income tax credit can bring more low-skilled workers into the labor force. Lower marginal tax rates on the returns to assets (such as interest, dividends, and capital gains) can encourage saving. Reducing marginal tax rates on business income can cause some companies to invest domestically rather than abroad. Tax breaks for research can encourage the creation of new ideas that spill over to help the broader economy.
</blockquote>

<p>
  (The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp">marginal tax rate</a> is the tax rate paid on additional dollar of income, or the tax rate paid at each of the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">tax brackets</a>. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp">Effective tax rates</a> are calculated by summing total marginal tax values and dividing by total taxable income (individual) or earnings before taxes (corporation). An example can be found on the marginal tax rate page linked at the beginning of this paragraph.)

<h3 id="medicine_nsaid">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3>

<p>
  Arthritis Foundation's <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/nsaids/nsaids">NSAID guide</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) from making hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are one of the body’s biggest contributors to inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your body makes two different kinds of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 helps protect your stomach lining and COX-2 plays a role in inflammation. Most NSAIDs are nonspecific, meaning they interfere with both COX-1 and COX-2. While this helps relieve pain and inflammation, it also leaves your stomach vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding. A specific type of NSAID, called a selective COX-2 inhibitor, blocks the COX-2 enzyme more than the COX-1 enzyme. The only selective COX-2 NSAID currently available in the United States is the prescription drug celecoxib (Celebrex).
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There is mixed evidence regarding <a href="https://medsask.usask.ca/documents/NSAIDS-with-Food.pdf">taking NSAIDs with food</a>, but generally seems to point to two conclusions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDs without food is healthy if NSAIDs are taken INfrequently
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDS without food if NOT healthy if NSAIDs are taken frequently
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Systemic NSAID effects rather than “topical” effects appear to be the major cause of serious GI adverse effects associated with NSAID use. Prostaglandins are important mediators in the maintenance of the protective mucous lining the GI tract. By inhibiting prostaglandins NSAIDs reduce this protection and leave the mucosa more susceptible to the damaging effects of gastric acid and digestive enzymes. NSAID-induced platelet inhibition and reduction in mucosal blood flow may also be factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Serious GI symptoms are more likely to occur with higher doses and longer duration of NSAID therapy
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Side effects include gastrointestinal problems (including bleeding, ulcers, and indigestion), kidney disease, adverse cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).
</p>

<p>
  Aspirin is an NSAID, but with the added effect of suppressing platelet function (i.e., thins bloods).

<h3 id="technology_mass_flow_controllers">Mass Flow Controllers</h3>

<p>
  Mass flow controllers (MFC) are used to flow a gas or liquid (gas is used throughout this section) at a specific rate. In contrast, mass flow meters do not allow for control of the gas, only measurement. Most industrial-grade MFCs are thermal MFCs.
</p>

<p>
  The most reliable method of MFC calibration is to calibrate it to a single gas and use it for a single gas. If needed, <a href="https://www.scribner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Application-Note-Gas-correction-factors.pdf">gas correction factors (GCFs)</a> can be used to flow a different type of gas. Generally, a N<sub>2</sub>-based MFC is used. A list of common GCFs can be found <a href="https://www.mksinst.com/n/gas-correction-factors-for-thermal-based-mass-flow-controllers">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  MFCs have ranges in the SCCM (standard cubic centimeters per minute) or SLM (standard liters per minute range) range. Flowing the upper values of these scales is not always completely achievable, e.g., flowing 49 SLM through a 50 SLM MFC may not happen (this is based on personal experience). Often times the bottom and top 10% ranges aren't used. MFCs come with a zeroing function—normally in the form of a button for digital devices and a potentiometer for analog devices—that allow the user to tell it when there is zero gas flowing through it. Brooks Instruments offers the following <a href="https://www.brooksinstrument.com/en/blog/is-your-mfc-displayingoutputting-a-flow-signal-or-negative-flow-with-no-gas">zeroing advice</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Allow for a warm-up time of at least 45 minutes to get to normal operating temperatures [this is especially important when using thermal MFCs]
    </li>
    <li>
      It is preferable to zero at process conditions (meaning inlet pressure should be the same as the normal device operation)
    </li>
    <li>
      Close a downstream shutoff valve and open the MFC valve using a setpoint or valve override (VOR) open command.  This will fill the lines up to the shutoff valve and pressure will equalize across the MFC.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow 30 seconds minimum for stabilization
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the output (PV) signal
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Wikipedia describes the MFC's inlet pressure requirement well:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Mass flow controllers require the supply gas or liquid to be within a specific pressure range. Low pressure will starve the MFC of fluid and cause it to fail to achieve its setpoint. High pressure may cause erratic flow rates.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Thermal MFC operation is <a href="https://www.mksinst.com/mam/celum/celum_assets/mks/resources/MassFlowTechnology-TechNote.pdf?0">explained by MKS</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The sensor is mounted on a side stream that takes a known ratio of the gas flow passing through the MFM. In a three-wire sensor configuration, the MFM uses high temperature coefficient of resistance wires as sensors to measure the temperature differential (\(\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1}\)), across a heater mounted on the side stream as shown in Figure 4. This temperature differential is directly proportional to the mass flow rate:
  </p>
  \[\text{mass flow rate} = \frac{\alpha \cdot P_{W}}{\Delta T \cdot C_{p}}\]
  <p>
    where \(P_{W}\) is the heater power setting, \(C_{p}\) is the heat capacity of the gas, and \(\alpha\) is a proportionality constant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thermal MFCs are both accurate and repeatable, precisely controlling gas flows between 2 and 100% of their Full Scale reading with a resolution of 0.1%
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Proportional solenoid valves are generally used as the controlling element in an MFC. Pneumatic- or servo-driven motors may also be used, but solenoid-driven valves are generally more reliable and accurate.
</p>

<p>
  MFCs are set as normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC). (NO) MFCs should be used when it's fine for the gas to be flowing the entire time, e.g., an MFC that allows N<sub>2</sub> to purge a loading area or non-processing chamber. If something interrupts the MFC's operation, it simply goes back to being completely open. (NC) MFCs should be used for hazardous gases or when it being fully open after an issue can present problems with the process it's being used for.
</p>
