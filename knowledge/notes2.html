<p>
  This is a place for me to take notes and write thoughts on economics, medicine, (geo)politics, and technology.
</p>

<p>
  The process of learning about these items follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a> algorithm, often using Wikipedia as the root node and following the search across a multitude of websites.
</p>

<p>
  Blockquotes (see below for example) are essentially direct quotes. For example, if the quote says "In our lives, we are constantly ...", I will shorten it to "We are constantly ...". No information is lost, but the note is shorter for reference and typing. Anything in [square brackets like this] is my personal note.

<h3 id="economics_money_banking">Economics of Money and Banking</h3>

<p>
  In an effort to learn more about macroeconomics as a whole, I took this well-reviewed course on Coursera.
</p>

<p>

</p>



<h3 id="economics_taxes">Taxes</h3>

<p>
  Taxes affect the economy in both the short- and long-term (from Tax Policy Center's <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-economy-short-run">briefing book</a>). First, the short-term.
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] primarily through their impact on demand. Tax cuts boost demand by increasing disposable income and by encouraging businesses to hire and invest more. Tax increases do the reverse. These demand effects can be substantial when the economy is weak but smaller when it is operating near capacity.
</blockquote>

<p>
  This can be quantified using the so-called "output multiplier":
</p>

<blockquote>
  How much tax cuts boost demand (or tax hikes restrain it) depends on the sensitivity of household and business behavior—for example, how households divide increased after-tax income between consumption and saving, and whether businesses choose to hire and invest more. Economists summarize these effects in a simple measure, the output multiplier, expressing how many dollars of increased economic activity result from a dollar reduction in taxes or a dollar increase in government spending.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In general, tax cuts do <i>not</i> help as much as spending increases do:
</p>

<blockquote>
  CBO’s estimates suggest that, dollar for dollar, tax cuts are often a less effective means of stimulus than are spending increases. If the federal government purchases goods and services itself (or helps state and local governments do so), most or all of the spending will boost demand. If the government cuts personal taxes, however, a substantial amount of the added spending power leaks into saving.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now, the long-term:
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] Primarily through the supply side. High marginal tax rates can discourage work, saving, investment, and innovation, while specific tax preferences can affect the allocation of economic resources. But tax cuts can also slow long-run economic growth by increasing deficits. The long-run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also their deficit effects.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<blockquote>
  taxes can affect both supply and demand factors. Reducing marginal tax rates on wages and salaries, for example, can induce people to work more. Expanding the earned income tax credit can bring more low-skilled workers into the labor force. Lower marginal tax rates on the returns to assets (such as interest, dividends, and capital gains) can encourage saving. Reducing marginal tax rates on business income can cause some companies to invest domestically rather than abroad. Tax breaks for research can encourage the creation of new ideas that spill over to help the broader economy.
</blockquote>

<p>
  (The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp">marginal tax rate</a> is the tax rate paid on additional dollar of income, or the tax rate paid at each of the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">tax brackets</a>. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp">Effective tax rates</a> are calculated by summing total marginal tax values and dividing by total taxable income (individual) or earnings before taxes (corporation). An example can be found on the marginal tax rate page linked at the beginning of this paragraph.)

<h3 id="medicine_nsaid">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3>

<p>
  Arthritis Foundation's <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/nsaids/nsaids">NSAID guide</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) from making hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are one of the body’s biggest contributors to inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your body makes two different kinds of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 helps protect your stomach lining and COX-2 plays a role in inflammation. Most NSAIDs are nonspecific, meaning they interfere with both COX-1 and COX-2. While this helps relieve pain and inflammation, it also leaves your stomach vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding. A specific type of NSAID, called a selective COX-2 inhibitor, blocks the COX-2 enzyme more than the COX-1 enzyme. The only selective COX-2 NSAID currently available in the United States is the prescription drug celecoxib (Celebrex).
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There is mixed evidence regarding <a href="https://medsask.usask.ca/documents/NSAIDS-with-Food.pdf">taking NSAIDs with food</a>, but generally seems to point to two conclusions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDs without food is healthy if NSAIDs are taken INfrequently
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDS without food if NOT healthy if NSAIDs are taken frequently
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Systemic NSAID effects rather than “topical” effects appear to be the major cause of serious GI adverse effects associated with NSAID use. Prostaglandins are important mediators in the maintenance of the protective mucous lining the GI tract. By inhibiting prostaglandins NSAIDs reduce this protection and leave the mucosa more susceptible to the damaging effects of gastric acid and digestive enzymes. NSAID-induced platelet inhibition and reduction in mucosal blood flow may also be factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Serious GI symptoms are more likely to occur with higher doses and longer duration of NSAID therapy
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Side effects include gastrointestinal problems (including bleeding, ulcers, and indigestion), kidney disease, adverse cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).
</p>

<p>
  Aspirin is an NSAID, but with the added effect of suppressing platelet function (i.e., thins bloods).

<h3 id="technology_pid_controllers">PID Controllers</h3>

<p>
  PID controllers attempt to match the actual value of a parameter to its desired setpoint by calculating an error value and correcting it based on three terms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    P: Term that is proportional to the error value. Larger \(K_{p}\) values result in larger over- and under-shoots while trying to attain the desired setpoint. Smaller \(K_{p}\) values result in virtually no overshoot and increase more gradually towards the setpoint.
  </li>
  <li>
    I: Term that integrates past values of the error. Larger \(K_{i}\) values result in larger over- and under-shoots while trying to attain the desired setpoint. Smaller \(K_{i}\) values result in virtually no overshoot and increase more gradually towards the setpoint.
  </li>
  <li>
    D: Term that derives the future value based on current rate of change (i.e., derivative).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Putting all three together, the control function is:
</p>

\[u(t) = K_{p}e(t) + K_{i} \int_{0}^{t}e(\tau)d\tau + K_{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt}\]

<h4 id="technology_pid_controllers_tuning">Tuning</h4>

<p>
  An overview of PID tuning methods can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Overview_of_tuning_methods">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Manual tuning involves the following procedure (taken from an uncited Wikipedia paragraph):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Set \(K_{i}\) and \(K_{d}\) to zero
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase \(K_{p}\) until the output begins to oscillate
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase \(K_{i}\) to correct any offsets
  </li>
  <li>
    Increase \(K_{d}\) to improve the the time in which the output reaches the setpoint
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="technology_pid_controllers_cascade">Cascade Control</h4>

<p>
  Cascade control uses two PID controllers: one controlling an outer loop and one controlling an inner loop. An example is given:
</p>

<blockquote>
  For example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater, where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.
</blockquote>

<p>
  From <a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Industrial_and_Systems_Engineering/Book%3A_Chemical_Process_Dynamics_and_Controls_(Woolf)/11%3A_Control_Architectures/11.03%3A_Cascade_control-_What_is_it%3F_When_useful%3F_When_not%3F_Common_usage.">Cascade Control</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The simplest cascade control scheme involves two control loops that use two measurement signals to control one primary variable. In such a control system, the output of the primary controller determines the set point for the secondary controller. The output of the secondary controller is used to adjust the control variable. Generally, the secondary controller changes quickly while the primary controller changes slowly. Once cascade control is implemented, disturbances from rapid changes of the secondary controller will not affect the primary controller.
</blockquote>


<h3 id="technology_check_valves">Check Valves</h3>

<p>
  Check valves allow liquid or gas to flow through it in one direction. The cracking pressure is the minimum differential pressure between inlet and outlet that allows the gas to flow. Sufficient pressure opens the valve enough for the gas to flow by. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_valve#/media/File:Checkvalveopen.svg">ball check valve</a> has a ball attached to a spring that opens when inlet pressure is greater than outlet. Other types include spring loaded in-line, diaphragm,
</p>

<p>
  Being practically one-way, check valves prevent backflow and thus any contamination that results from backflow. This requires a leak-tight seal (which can wear over time, depending on the application) and fast closing (helped by gravity and/or a fast spring).
</p>

<p>
  Follow-up question: is there a range of cracking pressures that correspond to a range of flows (i.e., it's not a binary open or closed)? If yes, this means a check valve can operate as a flow controller based on pressure.
</p>

<h3 id="technology_mass_flow_controllers">Mass Flow Controllers</h3>

<p>
  Mass flow controllers (MFC) are used to flow a gas or liquid (gas is used throughout this section) at a specific rate. In contrast, mass flow meters do not allow for control of the gas, only measurement. Most industrial-grade MFCs are thermal MFCs.
</p>

<p>
  The most reliable method of MFC calibration is to calibrate it to a single gas and use it for a single gas. If needed, <a href="https://www.scribner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Application-Note-Gas-correction-factors.pdf">gas correction factors (GCFs)</a> can be used to flow a different type of gas. Generally, a N<sub>2</sub>-based MFC is used. A list of common GCFs can be found <a href="https://www.mksinst.com/n/gas-correction-factors-for-thermal-based-mass-flow-controllers">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  MFCs have ranges in the SCCM (standard cubic centimeters per minute) or SLM (standard liters per minute range) range. Flowing the upper values of these scales is not always completely achievable, e.g., flowing 49 SLM through a 50 SLM MFC may not happen (this is based on personal experience). Often times the bottom and top 10% ranges aren't used. MFCs come with a zeroing function—normally in the form of a button for digital devices and a potentiometer for analog devices—that allow the user to tell it when there is zero gas flowing through it. Brooks Instruments offers the following <a href="https://www.brooksinstrument.com/en/blog/is-your-mfc-displayingoutputting-a-flow-signal-or-negative-flow-with-no-gas">zeroing advice</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Allow for a warm-up time of at least 45 minutes to get to normal operating temperatures [this is especially important when using thermal MFCs]
    </li>
    <li>
      It is preferable to zero at process conditions (meaning inlet pressure should be the same as the normal device operation)
    </li>
    <li>
      Close a downstream shutoff valve and open the MFC valve using a setpoint or valve override (VOR) open command.  This will fill the lines up to the shutoff valve and pressure will equalize across the MFC.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow 30 seconds minimum for stabilization
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the output (PV) signal
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Wikipedia describes the MFC's inlet pressure requirement well:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Mass flow controllers require the supply gas or liquid to be within a specific pressure range. Low pressure will starve the MFC of fluid and cause it to fail to achieve its setpoint. High pressure may cause erratic flow rates.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Thermal MFC operation is <a href="https://www.mksinst.com/mam/celum/celum_assets/mks/resources/MassFlowTechnology-TechNote.pdf?0">explained by MKS</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The sensor is mounted on a side stream that takes a known ratio of the gas flow passing through the MFM. In a three-wire sensor configuration, the MFM uses high temperature coefficient of resistance wires as sensors to measure the temperature differential (\(\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1}\)), across a heater mounted on the side stream as shown in Figure 4. This temperature differential is directly proportional to the mass flow rate:
  </p>
  \[\text{mass flow rate} = \frac{\alpha \cdot P_{W}}{\Delta T \cdot C_{p}}\]
  <p>
    where \(P_{W}\) is the heater power setting, \(C_{p}\) is the heat capacity of the gas, and \(\alpha\) is a proportionality constant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thermal MFCs are both accurate and repeatable, precisely controlling gas flows between 2 and 100% of their Full Scale reading with a resolution of 0.1%
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Proportional solenoid valves are generally used as the controlling element in an MFC. Pneumatic- or servo-driven motors may also be used, but solenoid-driven valves are generally more reliable and accurate.
</p>

<p>
  MFCs are set as normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC). (NO) MFCs should be used when it's fine for the gas to be flowing the entire time, e.g., an MFC that allows N<sub>2</sub> to purge a loading area or non-processing chamber. If something interrupts the MFC's operation, it simply goes back to being completely open. (NC) MFCs should be used for hazardous gases or when it being fully open after an issue can present problems with the process it's being used for.
</p>
