<p>
  This is a place for me to take notes on economics, medicine, and (geo)politics.
</p>

<p>
  Blockquotes (see below for example) are essentially direct quotes. For example, if the quote says "In our lives, we are constantly ...", I will shorten it to "We are constantly ...". No information is lost, but the note is shorter for reference and typing. Anything in [square brackets like this] is my personal note.

  In reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/nw2b1v/things_every_educated_21stcentury_person_should/">this r/SSC thread</a> and seeing this comment:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Basic economics concepts like prices being set by supply and demand, elasticity, comparative advantage, effects of taxation and subsidies, efficient market hypothesis, are shockingly poorly understood by most people.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I realized I know virtually nothing about economics. This is my attempt to change that.

<h3 id="nsaid">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3>

<p>
  Arthritis Foundation's <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/nsaids/nsaids">NSAID guide</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) from making hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are one of the body’s biggest contributors to inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your body makes two different kinds of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 helps protect your stomach lining and COX-2 plays a role in inflammation. Most NSAIDs are nonspecific, meaning they interfere with both COX-1 and COX-2. While this helps relieve pain and inflammation, it also leaves your stomach vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding. A specific type of NSAID, called a selective COX-2 inhibitor, blocks the COX-2 enzyme more than the COX-1 enzyme. The only selective COX-2 NSAID currently available in the United States is the prescription drug celecoxib (Celebrex).
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There is mixed evidence regarding <a href="https://medsask.usask.ca/documents/NSAIDS-with-Food.pdf">taking NSAIDs with food</a>, but generally seems to point to two conclusions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDs without food is healthy if NSAIDs are taken INfrequently
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDS without food if NOT healthy if NSAIDs are taken frequently
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Systemic NSAID effects rather than “topical” effects appear to be the major cause of serious GI adverse effects associated with NSAID use. Prostaglandins are important mediators in the maintenance of the protective mucous lining the GI tract. By inhibiting prostaglandins NSAIDs reduce this protection and leave the mucosa more susceptible to the damaging effects of gastric acid and digestive enzymes. NSAID-induced platelet inhibition and reduction in mucosal blood flow may also be factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Serious GI symptoms are more likely to occur with higher doses and longer duration of NSAID therapy
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Side effects include gastrointestinal problems (including bleeding, ulcers, and indigestion), kidney disease, adverse cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).
</p>

<p>
  Aspirin is an NSAID, but with the added effect of suppressing platelet function (i.e., thins bloods).
