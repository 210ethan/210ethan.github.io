<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to take notes and write thoughts on economics, medicine, (geo)politics, and technology.
</p>

<p>
  The process of learning about these items follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a> algorithm, often using Wikipedia as the root node and following the search across a multitude of websites.
</p>

<p>
  Blockquotes (see below for example) are essentially direct quotes. For example, if the quote says "In our lives, we are constantly ...", I will shorten it to "We are constantly ...". No information is lost, but the note is shorter for reference and typing. Anything in [square brackets like this] is my personal note.

<h3 id="economics_taxes">Taxes</h3>

<p>
  Taxes affect the economy in both the short- and long-term (from Tax Policy Center's <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-economy-short-run">briefing book</a>). First, the short-term.
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] primarily through their impact on demand. Tax cuts boost demand by increasing disposable income and by encouraging businesses to hire and invest more. Tax increases do the reverse. These demand effects can be substantial when the economy is weak but smaller when it is operating near capacity.
</blockquote>

<p>
  This can be quantified using the so-called "output multiplier":
</p>

<blockquote>
  How much tax cuts boost demand (or tax hikes restrain it) depends on the sensitivity of household and business behavior—for example, how households divide increased after-tax income between consumption and saving, and whether businesses choose to hire and invest more. Economists summarize these effects in a simple measure, the output multiplier, expressing how many dollars of increased economic activity result from a dollar reduction in taxes or a dollar increase in government spending.
</blockquote>

<p>
  In general, tax cuts do <i>not</i> help as much as spending increases do:
</p>

<blockquote>
  CBO’s estimates suggest that, dollar for dollar, tax cuts are often a less effective means of stimulus than are spending increases. If the federal government purchases goods and services itself (or helps state and local governments do so), most or all of the spending will boost demand. If the government cuts personal taxes, however, a substantial amount of the added spending power leaks into saving.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Now, the long-term:
</p>

<blockquote>
  [In the short term:] Primarily through the supply side. High marginal tax rates can discourage work, saving, investment, and innovation, while specific tax preferences can affect the allocation of economic resources. But tax cuts can also slow long-run economic growth by increasing deficits. The long-run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also their deficit effects.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<blockquote>
  taxes can affect both supply and demand factors. Reducing marginal tax rates on wages and salaries, for example, can induce people to work more. Expanding the earned income tax credit can bring more low-skilled workers into the labor force. Lower marginal tax rates on the returns to assets (such as interest, dividends, and capital gains) can encourage saving. Reducing marginal tax rates on business income can cause some companies to invest domestically rather than abroad. Tax breaks for research can encourage the creation of new ideas that spill over to help the broader economy.
</blockquote>

<p>
  (The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp">marginal tax rate</a> is the tax rate paid on additional dollar of income, or the tax rate paid at each of the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">tax brackets</a>. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp">Effective tax rates</a> are calculated by summing total marginal tax values and dividing by total taxable income (individual) or earnings before taxes (corporation). An example can be found on the marginal tax rate page linked at the beginning of this paragraph.)

<h3 id="medicine_nsaid">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3>

<p>
  Arthritis Foundation's <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/nsaids/nsaids">NSAID guide</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) from making hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are one of the body’s biggest contributors to inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your body makes two different kinds of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 helps protect your stomach lining and COX-2 plays a role in inflammation. Most NSAIDs are nonspecific, meaning they interfere with both COX-1 and COX-2. While this helps relieve pain and inflammation, it also leaves your stomach vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding. A specific type of NSAID, called a selective COX-2 inhibitor, blocks the COX-2 enzyme more than the COX-1 enzyme. The only selective COX-2 NSAID currently available in the United States is the prescription drug celecoxib (Celebrex).
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There is mixed evidence regarding <a href="https://medsask.usask.ca/documents/NSAIDS-with-Food.pdf">taking NSAIDs with food</a>, but generally seems to point to two conclusions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDs without food is healthy if NSAIDs are taken INfrequently
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking NSAIDS without food if NOT healthy if NSAIDs are taken frequently
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Systemic NSAID effects rather than “topical” effects appear to be the major cause of serious GI adverse effects associated with NSAID use. Prostaglandins are important mediators in the maintenance of the protective mucous lining the GI tract. By inhibiting prostaglandins NSAIDs reduce this protection and leave the mucosa more susceptible to the damaging effects of gastric acid and digestive enzymes. NSAID-induced platelet inhibition and reduction in mucosal blood flow may also be factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Serious GI symptoms are more likely to occur with higher doses and longer duration of NSAID therapy
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Side effects include gastrointestinal problems (including bleeding, ulcers, and indigestion), kidney disease, adverse cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).
</p>

<p>
  Aspirin is an NSAID, but with the added effect of suppressing platelet function (i.e., thins bloods).
