<h1>Books</h1>

I am active on Goodreads (see my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ethan97">account here</a>). I try to review most of the books I read, but especially the non-fiction ones.







<h3>Favorite and Important Books</h3>

Favorite does not necessarily mean important, nor vice versa. I will define them as:
<ul>
  <li>Favorite: A book I thoroughly enjoyed.</li>
  <li>Important: A book I think everyone should read in their lifetime.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Favorites</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83017.The_Tartar_Steppe?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=8TsI9PweeT&rank=1#">The Tartar Steppe</a> by Dino Buzzati. A novel about a young, freshly-graduated officer who gets stationed in a remote outpost and spends all of his life waiting for the "big event" to happen (Tartars invading). The story is meant to [FINISH] </li>
</ul>










<h4>Important</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">GÃ¶del, Escher and Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a> by Douglas Hofstadter. Winner of the 1980 <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/223">Pulitzer Prize</a> and arguably one of the most important books ever written. Admittedly, my reading of it was not as thorough as it should have been (I was age 18 at the time) and I did not retain as much as I would have liked, but that does not diminish its significance. Eliezer Yudkowsky claims it as "<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/bookshelf.html#k_geb">the best and most beautiful book ever written</a>," and plenty of others resonate with that statement (see other Goodreads reviews).
