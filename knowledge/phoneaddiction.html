<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>
  Free time is the most valuable resource available, yet most of it gets taken by unproductive, worthless screen time. Life passes by while staring at the screenâ€”social interactions missed or ruined, improvement opportunities forgone. But we never notice nor appreciate the harm these devices are doing to our lives.

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>

<p>
  These are specific to iPhones running iOS and in no particular order. Results may vary. Use none, one, some, or all.
</p>

<p>
  Summary is straightforward: make the phone as boring and uninviting as possible by minimizing aesthetics and attention-grabbing methods.
</p>

<h3 id="websites">Block Websites</h3>

<p>
  Blocking distracting websites is an easy way to make the phone less attractive.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen Time
  </li>
  <li>
    Content & Privacy Restrictions
  </li>
  <li>
    Content Restrictions
  </li>
  <li>
    Web Content
  </li>
  <li>
    Select "Limit Adult Websites"
  </li>
  <li>
    Add distracting websites to the "Never Allow" section
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="home">Home Screen</h3>

<p>
  Apps that are used on a frequent basis (Phone, Messages, email) should be placed on the bottom-most row of the home screen. All other apps should be placed into a folder.
</p>

<p>
  Apps can also be removed from the home screen without being deleted from the phone. Just press-and-hold an app and select "Remove From Home Screen". Search for it when needed.
</p>

<p>
  Delete social media apps and games. The only apps on the phone should be those that serve a productive purpose.
</p>

<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>

<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>

<p>
  Minimize the amount of notifications that are shown on the screen. Examples of needed notifications are phone calls, messages, and emails. Examples of unneeded notifications are dating app messages, fitness apps, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Turn them off as needed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Notifications
  </li>
  <li>
    Set banners, sounds, and badges as needed
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sounds">Sounds</h4>

<p>
  Notification sounds should not be pleasant (but they need not be unpleasant). Experiment with the notification sounds to see which one is the most neutral.
</p>

<p>
  Turn off keyboard feedback:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Sounds & Haptics
  </li>
  <li>
    Keyboard Feedback
  </li>
  <li>
    Sound: off
  </li>
  <li>
    Haptic: off
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="filters">Email Filters</h4>

<p>
  Minimize the amount of emails that can pop up on the screen by setting up filters. Notifications that an item has shipped or a regular bill should be placed into their own folder without notifying the receiver.
</p>

<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>

<p>
  Minimize aesthetic movements on the phone screen.
