<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p>
  Different types of terrain require different bikes to get the job done comfortably and efficiently. Flat, smooth trails can easily be traversed with a suspension-less bike, while steep, rocky trails require longer suspension and sturdier builds to absorb the hits. Geometries play a role in bike stability, handling, and comfort. Examining the environment and riding style is the first step in choosing a mountain bike.
</p>

<h3 id="types_suspension">Suspension</h3>

<p>
  There are effectively three types of suspensions in regards to mountain bikes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Rigid: No suspension whatsoever. The fork is made of solid metal and the frame is a single piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hardtail: Front suspension only. The frame is a single piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full Suspension: Front and rear suspension. The frame is two pieces and connected by the rear suspension.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="head_angle">Head Angle</h3>

<p>
  Head angle geometries also come into play in determining the type of terrain the bike can handle. The head angle is defined as the angle between the fork and rear axle:

<p>
  MTB Direct puts the advantages and disadvantages of smaller and larger head angles succinctly:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Pros [smaller head angle, 62째 minimum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The fork will be able to suck up bumps better at higher speeds
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased stability as the wheels are further apart
    </li>
    <li>
      Better high speed cornering
    </li>
    <li>
      Less of the "I'm going to go over the bars!" feeling
    </li>
    <li>
      Confidence inspiring to ride in steep terrain
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Cons [smaller head angle, 62째 minimum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Steering is slower and less responsive
    </li>
    <li>
      Front wheel can "flop" from one side to the other on tight corners
    </li>
    <li>
      Worsened tight turning performance
    </li>
    <li>
      Not so nice to ride on flatter terrain
    </li>
    <li>
      Does not climb well and the front wheel tends to wander as there is less weight on it
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Pros [larger head angle, 73째 maximum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Faster handling speed and better response
    </li>
    <li>
      Better cornering in tight terrain and a tighter turning radius
    </li>
    <li>
      Feels great on flatter terrain and "ducks and weaves" better
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased climbing performance
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Cons [larger head angle, 73째 maximum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Feels unstable and "twitchy" at higher speeds
    </li>
    <li>
      Feels like you could get sent over the bars a lot easier
    </li>
    <li>
      Doesn't absorb bumps as well at high speeds (the fork is more perpendicular to the bump than it is with a slack angle)
    </li>
    <li>
      Tends to get "hung up" on bigger bumps more
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There's a balance to be had, of course. Some bikes, such as the <a href="https://www.ibiscycles.com/bikes/ripley">Ibis Ripley</a>, offer moderate head angles to allow for both efficient climbing and fun descending.
</p>

<h3 id="chainstay_length">Chainstay Length</h3>

<p>
  Chainstay length is defined as the distance from the bottom bracket to the rear axle and provides differences in handling capabilities. From Bike Insight's article on <a href="https://bikeinsights.com/cyclopedia/chainstay-length">chainstay length</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Qualities of shorter chainstays:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Shift center-of-mass rearward rearward to balance a more aggressive rider position
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce turning radius for quicker handling
    </li>
    <li>
      Stiffen frame
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce likelihood of chain-on-tire rub
    </li>
    <li>
      Easier to lift the front wheel for manuals, wheelies, bunny hops
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Qualities of longer chainstays:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Shift center-of-mass frontward rearward to balance a more upright rider position
    </li>
    <li>
      More stable handling
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased compliance for a smoother-feeling ride
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduced vertical-displacement at the saddle over bumps
    </li>
    <li>
      Greater heel clearance for rear panniers
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Some bikes come with <a href="https://forums.thepaceline.net/showthread.php?t=200568">adjustable dropouts</a>, allowing the chainstays to be shortened at will.

<h2 id="wheels">Wheels</h2>

<p>
  Taylor Jones' <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com/blog/mountain-bike-wheels-what-to-know">Mountain Bike Wheels: What to Know</a> provides an excellent overview of wheels.
</p>

<h3 id="wheel_size">Size</h3>

<p>
  Current wheel sizes (measured by diameter) are 26 in., 27.5 in., and 29 in. (and sometimes 28.125 in., as in the case of an April Fools' Day prank that I cannot find a source on).
</p>

<img src="media/26_275_29.jpg" width="200" class="center">
<figcaption align="middle">
  26 vs. 27.5 vs. 29 (<a href="http://www.mtbcommunity.com/blog/item/do-you-want-a-27-5-inch-wheel-mountain-bike">source</a>)
</figcaption>

<p>
  As with the various geometries discussed in the <a href="#types">Types</a> section, each wheel poses distinct advantages and disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
  26 in. advantages (A) and disadvantages (D):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A: Smaller turn radius, allowing for tighter corners to be ridden and easier handling
  </li>
  <li>
    A: Lighter
  </li>
  <li>
    D: More difficult to overcome obstacles than with larger wheels
  </li>
  <li>
    D: More pedal strokes per unit time at constant power to keep up with larger wheels (one revolution of the pedals produces \(26\pi\) in. of distance traveled)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  29 in. advantages (A) and disadvantages (D):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    D: Larger turn radius, requiring more room in tight corners
  </li>
  <li>
    D: Heavier
  </li>
  <li>
    A: Easier to overcome obstacles than with smaller wheels
  </li>
  <li>
    A: Less pedal strokers per unit time at constant power to keep up with larger wheels (one revolution of the pedals produces \(29\pi\) in. distance traveled, or 1.12x that of a 26 in. wheel
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  27 in. advantages and disadvantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A/D: A happy compromise between 26 and 29 in. wheels for a bit (not necessarily the best) of both worlds
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wheels_spokes">Spokes</h3>

<p>
  Spokes connect the hub and rim, providing support for the entire wheel. More spokes provide more support, but also more weight. For reference, <a href="https://wheelbuilder.com/dt-competition-double-butted-spoke/">this spoke</a> adds 191 g (0.42 lb, 0.19 kg) to a 32-spoke wheel (which both my fixie and one of my mountain bikes are equipped with), a negligible amount unless you are a competitive rider.
