<!--

- history of bikes

- types: xc, dirt jump, downhill, enduro
- geometries conducive to each type

- wheels: size, spokes, material, tires, tubeless vs tubed, hubs, through axle vs quick release
- suspension: types (rigid, hardtail, full sus) how shocks work and are made, front (lefty, dual crown, standard), rear shock (coil, other kind, orientation, placement, weird specialized)
- drivetrain: 1-3x9-12 shifting, derailleurs, electronic, why top of line is so expensive, how gears work (big up front = harder, big in back = easier, vice versa), silent hubs
- brakes: V, U, disc (mechanical, hydraulic), bleeding brakes, adjusting brake pads
- handlebars: grips, width, rise/drop
- pedals: flat, spd, crankbros

<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p>
  Different types of terrain require different bikes to get the job done comfortably and efficiently. Flat, smooth trails can easily be traversed with a suspension-less bike, while steep, rocky trails require longer suspension and sturdier builds to absorb the hits. Examining the environment and riding style is the first step in choosing a mountain bike.
</p>

<h3 id="types_suspension">Suspension</h3>

<p>
  There are effectively three types of suspensions in regards to mountain bikes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Rigid: No suspension whatsoever. The fork is made of solid metal and the frame is a single piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hardtail: Front suspension only. The frame is a single piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full Suspension: Front and rear suspension. The frame is two pieces and connected by the rear suspension.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="head_angle">Head Angle</h3>

<p>
  Head angle geometries also come into play in determining the type of terrain the bike can handle. The head angle is defined as the angle between the fork and rear axle:

<p>
  MTB Direct puts the advantages and disadvantages of smaller and larger head angles succinctly:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Pros [smaller head angle, 62째 minimum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The fork will be able to suck up bumps better at higher speeds
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased stability as the wheels are further apart
    </li>
    <li>
      Better high speed cornering
    </li>
    <li>
      Less of the "I'm going to go over the bars!" feeling
    </li>
    <li>
      Confidence inspiring to ride in steep terrain
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Cons [smaller head angle, 62째 minimum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Steering is slower and less responsive
    </li>
    <li>
      Front wheel can "flop" from one side to the other on tight corners
    </li>
    <li>
      Worsened tight turning performance
    </li>
    <li>
      Not so nice to ride on flatter terrain
    </li>
    <li>
      Does not climb well and the front wheel tends to wander as there is less weight on it
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Pros [larger head angle, 73째 maximum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Faster handling speed and better response
    </li>
    <li>
      Better cornering in tight terrain and a tighter turning radius
    </li>
    <li>
      Feels great on flatter terrain and "ducks and weaves" better
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased climbing performance
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Cons [larger head angle, 73째 maximum]:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Feels unstable and "twitchy" at higher speeds
    </li>
    <li>
      Feels like you could get sent over the bars a lot easier
    </li>
    <li>
      Doesn't absorb bumps as well at high speeds (the fork is more perpendicular to the bump than it is with a slack angle)
    </li>
    <li>
      Tends to get "hung up" on bigger bumps more
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There's a balance to be had, of course. Some bikes, such as the <a href="https://www.ibiscycles.com/bikes/ripley">Ibis Ripley</a>, offer moderate head angles to allow for both efficient climbing and fun descending.

<h3 id="chainstay_length">Chainstay Length</h3>

<p>
  Chainstay length is defined as the distance from the bottom bracket to the rear axle.
