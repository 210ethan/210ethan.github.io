<h1 id="office">Office Space Review</h1>

<p>
  Office Space is easily in my top five favorite movies of all-time. (I hesitate ranking them directly, since they all differ in genre and other elements.)

  D H on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7SNEdjftno">corporate culture</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The point is not that she doesn't appreciate her job. It's that the non-sensibilities of management have placed a premium on something other than effective performance metrics. When extra, useless things are added, your job becomes more complicated in a way that is not important. The "flair" is not for customers, it is to demonstrate willingness to debase oneself to do even unimportant things that are required by the manager - a way to separate the climbers from the people who are just trying to do their job and serve the customer. That's corporate culture for you, because they reward ambition over effort and ability - this is a common tactic of inept management, and it usually keeps the sensible, competent people out of management positions and brings the ass-kissers up the ladder. These are the same corporations that forget about taking care of their employees in order to provide better service to customers, and who develop products centered on consumer statistics rather than on a healthy valuing of the person who buys the product. This is why we have houses contaminated with lead-based paint and whipped cream dispensers that can kill you when they malfunction. Flair was a clear-cut iconization of this corporate attitude which is not capitalism, but a form of reverse-fascism.
