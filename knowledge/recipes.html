</p>

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<p>
  Ingredients:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)
  </li>
  <li>
    0.3 cup butter, unsalted or salted, melted
  </li>
  <li>
    0.5 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 pinch salt
  </li>
  <li>
    0.75 cup sugar (0.5 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 large egg, beaten
  </li>
  <li>
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  </li>
  <li>
    1.5 cups all-purpose flour
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Procedure: (Note that this recipe is designed for an 8x4 pan.)
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Set oven to 350 °F
  </li>
  <li>
    Mash bananas in large mixing bowl. No chunks should be left.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix in melted butter
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix in baking soda and salt
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix in sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix in flour. Make sure no flour is left on bowl—it can get trapped at the bottom!
  </li>
  <li>
    Butter pan
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour batter into pan
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake 55-65 min
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
  0.5 cup sugar is probably a bit on the low side for most people. 0.75 cup sugar is probably a solid bet.
</p>

<p>
  A bit more butter wouldn't be a bad idea for moistness.

</p>

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<p>
  Ingredients:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2 pounds (32 oz) full-fat cream cheese, room temperature
  </li>
  <li>
    1.3 cup white granulated sugar
  </li>
  <li>
    5 large eggs, room temperature
  </li>
  <li>
    1.25 cup heavy cream, room temperature
  </li>
  <li>
    2 teaspoon vanilla extract
  </li>
  <li>
    1 teaspoon fine sea salt* (plus optional flaky sea salt for topping)
  </li>
  <li>
    0.25 cup all-purpose flour
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Procedure:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Heat oven to 400 °F
  </li>
  <li>
    Line 9-inch springform pan with two large crisscrossed sheets of parchment paper. This was kind of a pain-in-the-ass, so I suggest overlapping outside of the pan, transferring them in together, then folding as needed while in the pan. I still didn't get it perfect. More practice...
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the cream cheese (2 lb / 32 oz) and granulated sugar (1.3 cup) to a large mixing bowl and use a handheld mixer on medium speed until the batter is smooth
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the eggs (5 total) one at a time, beating on medium-low speed until each egg is combined before adding in the next
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the cream (1.25 cup), vanilla extract (2 tsp), salt (1 tsp) and mix on low speed until evenly combined
  </li>
  <li>
    Sprinkle the flour (0.25 cup) evenly over the batter (it helps to sift it through a fine-mesh strainer to prevent lumps) and mix on low speed until evenly combined
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour the mixture into the parchment-lined pan and smooth out as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the cheesecake to a wire baking rack and let it cool completely to room temperature
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the sides of the springform pan, peel back the parchment, and cut
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
  Overbeating the batter can cause too much air to enter and a puffy cheesecake. If overbeat, letting the batter sit for some time then tapping the bottom of the bowl can alleviate this. (This seems like a good idea regardless.)

<h2 id="beef_wellington">Beef Wellington</h2>

<p>
  A famous dish that is a lot easier to make than people expect. A great addition to a holiday meal. Pairs well with vegetables. I went with roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes, and red wine and it was a hit.
</p>

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<p>
  Ingredients (recommended amounts in parentheses):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Center-cut beef tenderloin (chateaubriand) (2.5-3 lb)
  </li>
  <li>
    Shallots (onions can substitute) (Two (2))
  </li>
  <li>
    Garlic cloves (Four (4))
  </li>
  <li>
    White cap mushrooms (1-1.5 lb)
  </li>
  <li>
    Puff pastry (store-bought or homemade) (One (1) lb)
  </li>
  <li>
    Dijon mustard (enough to entirely brush the tenderloin)
  </li>
  <li>
    Thinly-sliced prosciutto (0.5 lb)
  </li>
  <li>
    Seasoning: Salt, pepper, thyme (optional)
  </li>
  <li>
    Olive oil
  </li>
  <li>
    Butter (1/4 tablespoon)
  </li>
  <li>
    Egg (One (1))
  </li>
  <li>
    Flour
  </li>
  <li>
    Parchment paper
  </li>
  <li>
    Brush
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Procedure:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If using store-bought puff pastry, follow the de-thawing instructions on the package.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set oven heat for 4xx °F and set up center rack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Season the beef with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (optional). Set aside or wrap in saran wrap and place in the refrigerator for extended period of time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dice up shallots, garlic cloves, and mushrooms (these three ingredients make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duxelles">duxelles</a>) into fine pieces. Heat up pan on medium-high heat, add olive oil and butter, then add the shallot, garlic, and mushrooms. Cook until golden brown and most of the moisture has evaporated. (Note: this may be longer than expected!) Leave duxelles to cool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sear beef tenderloin by placing on pan. Ensure even searing on all sides, including the end caps. To maintain its cylindrical shape, butcher's twine can be tied beforehand. Immediately brush the now-seared tenderloin with dijon mustard on all sides and let rest for a couple of minutes while continuing on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Roll out the puff pastry if it is not large enough to fit around the tenderloin. Lay out the pieces of prosciutto on the puff pastry, then evenly spread the duxelles on top. Leave an inch or so on all sides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat an egg and add a tablespoon or so of water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the rested tenderloin on the puff pastry-prosciutto-duxelles sheet, then tightly roll the tenderloin. Place on parchment paper on a baking sheet, tie the sides off and brush the entire "log" with egg wash. Make sure the seam side is down! Cut slits on top of the log to allow steam to escape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place log into oven for ~25 minutes and cook to medium rare. (Note: if you cook any more than medium rare you will be visited by the Beef Wellington Police and taken to a secret torture prison to learn about your wrongdoings.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow log to rest for 5-10 minutes after removing from the oven.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enjoy!
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The duxelles needs to be cut <i>fine</i>. Take some time to make sure all the pieces are tiny. My second time making this I probably spent 30-45 minutes until I was happy. Too large of pieces doesn't allow for the paste to form properly and prevents the duxelles, pastry/prosciutto, and beef from sticking together.
  </li>
  <li>
    The duxelles needs to be cooked on <b>high</b> and for a longer time than one would think. My second time making this I was impatient and thought it was fine, but was met with flowing juices after putting it on the puff pastry, causing a soggy bottom (but an otherwise delicious meal).
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the searing tool used can accommodate the full length of the tenderloin. Beef tenderloins are not very pliable and thus cannot be "bent" to fit in a circular pan (not like I did something like this...).
  </li>
</ul>
