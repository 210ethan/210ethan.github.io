<p>
  Conversation is incredibly important. It's how knowledge is transmitted and received, it's how relationships are formed, it's how boring car rides are made fun. It's everywhere: at the coffee shop, the hotel desk, the water cooler, the telephoneâ€”you name it, people are or have talked there. And it's not just ubiquitous, it's timeless.
</p>

<p>
  With such a widespread activity in both the time and location domains, becoming good at conversations becomes crucial for two reasons.
</p>

<p>
  First, happiness. It's simply fun and rewarding to have an awesome conversation, even if it's a stranger and/or an unfamiliar topic.
</p>

<p>
  Second, others like you more because [why]
