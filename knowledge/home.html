<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

considerations for buying house: valuation over years, neighborhood, schools--

<h3 id="proximity">Proximity</h3>

<p>
  Location should be influenced by personality type. Sociable and likes to go out a lot? Look for a condo or apartment in the fun part of town, or close to. Reclusive and want to be isolated? Look far out from the busy parts of the city. Somewhere in between? Find a happy medium of suburb/city life.
</p>

<p>
  This is one of my main regrets about my house. Without traffic, it takes me at least 25 minutes to get to the fun part of Dallas. With traffic, it takes 45. This limits friendships, relationships, and the population of possible roommates. Who wants to drive 30-45 minutes after work to go visit someone or be far from "fun"?
</p>

<p>
  A few example of hobbies, essentials, and activities that should be taken into account:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Grocery store
  </li>
  <li>
    Home improvement store
  </li>
  <li>
    Gym
  </li>
  <li>
    Restaurants
  </li>
  <li>
    Nightlife
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="work_needed">Work Needed</h3>

<p>
  Most homeowners seem to start out giddy with excitement at everything they plan to do around the house: improve this, install that, remodel here. The goals are lofty, but gradually wane as they realize the undertaking the projects requires. Improvements take time, energy, and money. They are rarely easy and often underestimated in terms of time and money needed. Coming home after a long, exhausting day of work and realizing there's even <i>more</i> work to do is a humbling experience. Doing work on weekends doesn't help. All this being said, the finishing the project and seeing the fruits of labor is a wonderful feeling.
</p>

<p>
  Work needed is not exclusive to improvements. It also encompasses maintenance and upkeep: yard work, cleaning, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Some options to lessen the burden include hiring someone else to do it, getting a friend to help you, or breaking it up into small, manageable chunks/goals that can be completed in a day or week.
</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>
  Many costs go towards a home which can be categorized into fixed (F), ever-increasing (I), or eventually-ending (E, as in it will effectively be completeat some point or the costs are negligible): mortgage (F), insurance (I), property taxes (I), improvements (E), homeowner association dues (I), maintenance and upkeep (F-ish, this is variable, but never ending and not necessarily ever-increasing), decorating (E).
</p>

<p>
  As with most things, the bigger or nicer something is, the more expensive it will be, both in upfront and recurring costs.
</p>

<h4 id="property_value_increases">Property Value Increases</h4>

<p>
  One sub-category of cost is the expected increase of property value due to a) standard appreciation, and b) improvements. Zillow offers <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">housing data</a>, some of which is determined through its <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-2019-deep-26226/">Zillow Home Value Index</a> measure and others through raw statistics. I could not find data on its forecasting accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  A few things to note regarding home value increases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a move is planned in the coming years to a different location with a lower COL rate of change, then a forecasted increase in property values is good. If a move is planned in the coming years to another location in the same city, then a forecasted increase is slightly negative due to closing costs and time spent on finding a new house. If no move is planned, then a forecasted increase in property value is good and bad: good because it's more money in case a move is made, bad because property tax and insurance fees increase over time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="information">Information</h2>

<p>
  This section is for various tips and knowledge I've learned.
</p>

<h3 id="landscaping">Landscaping</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Weed barrier fabrics do NOT work. Period. This is not from personal experience, but rather everyone on the internet deeming it so, which is good enough for me. Weeds will break through at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fabric also reduces the amount of air and organic matter from reaching the soil. The soil's health deteriorates because of this, causing any plants in the area to have growth issues.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    There is practically no such thing as a maintenance-free yard. Mulch needs to be reapplied on a (bi-)yearly basis, weeds will often need to be picked.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<h3 id="suggestions_inspection">Inspection</h3>

<p>
  There were a few things I wished I had inspected more thoroughly <i>myself</i> during inspection. These could have made move-in a bit easier and less stressful.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Foundation:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do doors bind at all (I believe this mostly happens as a result of hinges, but still worth checking!)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in the middle of the brick, if brick is installed? "Stair step" cracking, which occurs in the mortar <i>between</i> the bricks themselves, is common.
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in any walls of the house?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Caulking: Has everywhere that needs to be caulked been caulked? This is especially important in bathrooms (sinks, bathtubs, showers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Appliances: Do they turn on and work properly? Is there anything strange happening with them?
  </li>
  <li>
    HVAC:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is there a P-trap in the inside unit's drain line?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the inside unit wired to reflect the outside unit's capabilities, and vice versa? My outside unit is single stage, but the inside unit was wired for two stage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Does the water meter show any minor leaks? Shut off all faucets in the house and observe the fine leak part of the water meter for a few minutes.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I also wish I had gotten two separate inspectors to come out. More eyes are almost always better, and one may have more expertise in one area than the other. An extra few hundreds dollars is well worth avoiding a major issue in the electrical, plumbing, foundation, or HVAC systems.
</p>

<h3 id="suggestions_cost">Cost Suggestions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    File for a homestead exemption. This will reduce property tax burden by 25%. It also caps property tax increases at 10% per year.
  </li>
  <li>
    If any rooms in the house are not being regularly used, close their HVAC vents. This prevents the warm/cool air from entering and focuses it on the rooms that need it most, reducing the work required to heat/cool the house.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a programmable thermostat to automatically or remotely adjust temperatures when not home.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="suggestions_convenience">Convenience</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Front door locks with a keypad are awesome. No more fumbling with keys or having to leave one hidden for people to get in. Guest codes can be set and erased for one-time use. Some locks even allow remote access.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a programmable thermostat to adjust the temperature without getting up.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="suggestions_misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Useful tools to have below. As the saying goes, it's better to have it before you need it.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Multimeter with leads. Good for testing outlets, fuses, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stud finder
      </li>
      <li>
        Rechargeable batteries: AA, AAA, 9 V
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/JONES-STEPHENS-Brass-Water-Meter-Box-Lid-Key-M07-001/100196078">Water meter box key</a> + <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/28-in-Solid-Steel-Water-Meter-Valve-Key-with-Grips-410-302-0111/311774568">water meter valve key</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Drill pilot holes for anything going into a wall or stud.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're hanging something from drywall, always use drywall anchors. And not the dinky ones that have to get hammered in, but the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/E-Z-Ancor-Twist-N-Lock-75-lbs-Medium-Duty-Drywall-Anchors-50-Pack-25310/100040265">thick ones</a> that require a Phillips-head screwdriver to get in. Much more secure, way fewer headaches.
  </li>
</ul>
