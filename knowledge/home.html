<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  In November 2021, I bought my first house in a quiet neighborhood. While it was recently renovated, there were/are still plenty of things I'd like to do with it. These projects have a variety of purposes: appearance, cost savings, fun, comfortability, ecological impact, etc.
</p>

<p>
  I hope this serves as reference for future me and future readers alike. May my documentation be good enough to inspire, guide, and ease others' burdens in the process of improving their homes.

<h2 id="considerations">Consideration</h2>

considerations for buying house: cost, valuation over years, neighborhood, schools--

<h3 id="proximity">Proximity</h3>

<p>
  Location should be influenced by personality type. Sociable and likes to go out a lot? Look for a condo or apartment in the fun part of town, or close to. Reclusive and want to be isolated? Look far out from the busy parts of the city. Somewhere in between? Find a happy medium of suburb/city life.
</p>

<p>
  This is one of my main regrets about my house. Without traffic, it takes me at least 25 minutes to get to the fun part of Dallas. With traffic, it takes 45. This limits friendships and relationships. Who wants to drive 30-45 minutes after work to go visit someone?
</p>

<p>
  A few example of hobbies, essentials, and activities that should be taken into account:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Grocery store
  </li>
  <li>
    Home improvement store
  </li>
  <li>
    Gym
  </li>
  <li>
    Restaurants
  </li>
  <li>
    Nightlife
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="work_needed">Work Needed</h3>

<p>
  Most homeowners seem to start out giddy with excitement at everything they plan to do around the house: improve this, install that, remodel here. The goals are lofty, but gradually wane as they realize the undertaking the projects requires. Improvements take time, energy, and money. They are rarely easy and often underestimated in terms of time and money needed. Coming home after a long, exhausting day of work and realizing there's even <i>more</i> work to do is a humbling experience. Doing work on weekends doesn't help.
</p>

<p>
  All this being said, the finishing the project and seeing the fruits of labor is a wonderful feeling.
</p>

<p>
  Some options to lessen the burden include hiring someone else to do it, getting a friend to help you, or breaking it up into small, manageable chunks/goals that can be completed in a day or week.

<h2 id="information">Information</h2>

<p>
  This section is for various tips and knowledge I've learned.
</p>

<h3 id="landscaping">Landscaping</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Weed barrier fabrics do NOT work. Period. This is not from personal experience, but rather everyone on the internet deeming it so, which is good enough for me. Weeds will break through at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fabric also reduces the amount of air and organic matter from reaching the soil. The soil's health deteriorates because of this, causing any plants in the area to have growth issues.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    There is practically no such thing as a maintenance-free yard. Mulch needs to be reapplied on a (bi-)yearly basis, weeds will often need to be picked.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<h3 id="suggestions_inspection">Inspection</h3>

<p>
  There were a few things I wished I had inspected more thoroughly <i>myself</i> during inspection. These could have made move-in a bit easier and less stressful.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Foundation:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do doors bind at all (I believe this mostly happens as a result of hinges, but still worth checking!)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in the middle of the brick, if brick is installed? "Stair step" cracking, which occurs in the mortar <i>between</i> the bricks themselves, is common.
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in any walls of the house?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Caulking: Has everyone that needs to be caulked been caulked? This is especially important in bathrooms (sinks, bathtubs, showers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Appliances: Do they turn on and work properly? Is there anything strange happening with them?
  </li>
  <li>
    HVAC:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is there a P-trap in the inside unit's drain line?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the inside unit wired to reflect the outside unit's capabilities, and vice versa? My outside unit is single stage, but the inside unit was wired for two stage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Does the water meter show any minor leaks?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I also wish I had gotten two separate inspectors to come out. More eyes are almost always better, and one may have more expertise in one area than the other. An extra few hundreds dollars is well worth avoiding a major issue in the electrical, plumbing, foundation, or HVAC systems.
</p>

<h3 id="suggestions_misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Always file for a homestead exemption. This will reduce property tax burden by 25%.
  </li>
</ul>
