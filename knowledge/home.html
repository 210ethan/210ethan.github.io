<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  In November 2021, I bought my first house in a quiet neighborhood. While it was recently renovated, there were/are still plenty of things I'd like to do with it. These projects have a variety of purposes: appearance, cost savings, fun, comfortability, ecological impact, etc.
</p>

<p>
  I hope this serves as reference for future me and future readers alike. May my documentation be good enough to inspire, guide, and ease others' burdens in the process of improving their homes.

<h3 id="suggestions_inspection">Inspection</h3>

<p>
  There were a few things I wished I had inspected more thoroughly <i>myself</i> during inspection. These could have made move-in a bit easier and less stressful.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Foundation:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do doors bind at all (I believe this mostly happens as a result of hinges, but still worth checking!)?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in the middle of the brick, if brick is installed? "Stair step" cracking, which occurs in the mortar <i>between</i> the bricks themselves, is common.
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there cracks in any walls of the house?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Caulking: Has everyone that needs to be caulked been caulked? This is especially important in bathrooms (sinks, bathtubs, showers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Appliances: Do they turn on and work properly? Is there anything strange happening with them?
  </li>
  <li>
    HVAC:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Is there a P-trap in the inside unit's drain line?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the inside unit wired to reflect the outside unit's capabilities, and vice versa? My outside unit is single stage, but the inside unit was wired for two stage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I also wish I had gotten two separate inspectors to come out. More eyes are almost always better, and one may have more expertise in one area than the other. An extra few hundreds dollars is well worth avoiding a major issue in the electrical, plumbing, foundation, or HVAC systems.
