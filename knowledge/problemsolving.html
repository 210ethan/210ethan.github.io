<p>
  A running list of problem solving techniques I use at work and in my everyday life. These are currently (18 July 2021) in no particular order.

<h2 id="background_philosophy">Background/Philosophy</h2>

<p>
  I currently (18 July 2021) work as an equipment engineer at a major semiconductor company's fab. My days are often filled with problem solving (PS): why did this happen, how can we prevent this, etc. And yet I continually find myself missing or overlooking things that are related to problems I've solved before, because I either forgot or just didn't apply a certain technique. I distinguish between two types of PS: reactive and proactive. Reactive PS involves finding why something suddenly stopped working. Proactive PS involves finding how to accomplish something. Some techniques overlap between the two, but will only be entered in one.
</p>

<p>
  This is my attempt to minimize future occurrences of that. The following techniques come from myself or other credited resources. Some work better in certain instances than others. Examples are provided for each, mostly in the context of my job. "PSer" is problem solver themself.

<h3 id="reactive_assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

<p>
  Assumptions make PS easier because they eliminate variables to consider during the process. However, many times assumptions prove to be false, leading the individual to look at other non-issues. Assumptions may be explicitly stated or subliminally assumed, the former of which is a bit better, as it gives more chance for someone else to bring up issue with it.
</p>

<p>
  Writing down a complete list of assumptions before PS can be helpful, albeit a bit awkward and momentum-stopping. Can any of these assumptions be quickly verified? Have any of these assumptions been false in the past, whether in this system or another?
</p>

<p>
  Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    PSer subliminally assumed the connector pins were inserted all the way and making good contact with the female end. They weren't. This led to looking at other non-issues.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reactive_changes">Changes</h3>

<p>
  What has changed within or happened to the system since this problem arose? Was anything non-standard performed? Was the work performed standardized (i.e., anyone who does it does it the exact same way)
</p>

<p>
  Often times, maintenance on the system can cause a problem to occur, whether due to the operator performing the maintenance doing something incorrectly, a replacement part being bad, etc. If there is a clear change in the before-after values/conditions/etc, then whatever occurred on that date is worth looking into.

<p>
  Standardization allows for variability of <a href="#reactive_change">changes</a> to be minimized. By everyone
