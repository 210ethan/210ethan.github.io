<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>
  Despite getting a degree in electrical engineering, I feel like I have very little practical knowledge of electronics. I did not enjoy analog nor digital design courses, instead opting for the more physics-based options (i.e., devices). University courses also do not provide practical, hands-on knowledge of electronics and troubleshooting them.
</p>

<p>
  In an effort to learn more about electronics and improve my career skills, here are some notes on various aspects of electronics. The goal is for a lay-person to read this page (when finished) and have a basic understanding of most electronics.
</p>

  All information is taken from Scherz's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Fourth-Scherz/dp/1259587541">Practical Electronics for Inventors, 4th edition</a> or my own knowledge, unless otherwise linked/attributed. There were a <a href="https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/physics/ph235/errata.pdf">mistakes in the second edition</a>, but they have seemingly since been corrected. The only errata I could find for the fourth edition is <a href="http://simonmonk.org/pefi4/">here</a>.

<h3 id="physics_units">Units</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_units">International System of Units</a> defines seven base units, only a few of which concern electronics: electric current, ampere (A); length, meter (m); time, second (s); mass, kilogram (kg); temperature, Kelvin (K). (The other two are light intensity, candela (Cd), and substance amount, mole (mol)).
</p>

<p>
  From these seven base units <a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html">all other units are derived</a>. For example, voltage, or the potential difference between two points, is defined as \(\text{V} = \frac{\text{kg}^{2} \cdot \text{m}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{s}^{3}}\).
</p>

<p>
  Let's define some common derived units:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    \(\Omega\): Ohm, or resistance of electric current: \(\frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{2}}{\text{A}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{3}}\)
  </li>
  <li>
    W: Watt, or electric power:
  </li>
</ul>
