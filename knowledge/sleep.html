  I probably don't get enough sleep. At the time of writing (09 September 2022), my last two weeks of sleep (measured as time in bed, not actually time spent asleep) have been 5, 6, 8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 4, and 6 hours. That span of 8-8-7-8 was because of a three-day weekend and working from home on the following day. I wake up exhausted and often convince myself to set another alarm for 10 minutes, despite knowing full well it won't help. My energy gets to regular levels by mid-morning and stays that way until late evening. I don't consume caffeine.
</p>

<p>
  Yet I refuse to go to bed earlier. I know I should, but I don't. Why? I have too much to do and sleep is for those who live boring lives.
</p>

<p>
  My life is pretty busy because of my own choosing. My average weekday looks like such:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wake up, get ready, and commute: 6:00-7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    Work and commute home: 7:00am-5:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Relax/hobbies: 5:30-7:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Training (preparation, session, cleanup): 7:30-9:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    To-do items and miscellaneous: 9:30-11:00pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep preparation: 11:00-11:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep: 11:30pm-6:00am
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sometimes I get off work around 4:00pm, sometimes I don't have many hobbies to do, sometimes my training sessions last 1:30 hr or even 2:30 hr, sometimes I have to finish up extra work in addition to my to-do items. Life comes down to <a href="../thoughts/priorities.html">priorities</a> and I seem to have too many, but none that I'm willing to give up. This leads to sleep going onto the chopping block.
</p>

<p>
  I've also (probably) bought too far in to the "sleeping in is wasting the day" mindset many people hold. I still believe in this: getting 10-12 hours of sleep <i>is</i> wasting the hours one could be awake experiencing the world and all it has to offer. However, that doesn't lead to the conclusion that sleep duration should be minimized as much as possible while still maintaining some semblance of sanity and motor functions. MacAskill's <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping">The philosophical case against oversleeping</a> does an excellent job of summing up my thoughts, but I took it an extra step and ignored her point about getting the sleep one needs, because need and <i>need</i> are two different things.
</p>

<p>
  So why write this post? Two reasons.
</p>

<p>
  First, I feel like my cognitive abilities have declined over the past year, and in reviewing my sleep logs, it follows a general lack of sleep. I occasionally have brain fog at work when someone asks me a question and I can't think of the answer. I miss what I think are grossly obvious observations or notes (I think this is more of a answer-being-obvious-after-being-shown type of effect, but who really knows). If I can get a better idea of the positive and negative effects of sleep and lack of sleep, respectively, then the part of me that stays up late may be more amenable to getting to bed early.
</p>

<p>
  Second, and as a result of the first reason, my aerobic and strength training will almost certainly improve with more sleep.
