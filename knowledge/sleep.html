<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  I probably don't get enough sleep. At the time of writing (09 September 2022), my last two weeks of sleep (measured as time in bed, not actually time spent asleep) have been 5, 6, 8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 4, and 6 hours. That span of 8-8-7-8 was because of a three-day weekend and working from home on the following day. I wake up exhausted and often convince myself to set another alarm for 10 minutes, despite knowing full well it won't help. My energy gets to regular levels by mid-morning and stays that way until late evening. I don't consume caffeine.
</p>

<p>
  Yet I refuse to go to bed earlier. I know I should, but I don't. Why? I have too much to do and sleep is for those who live boring lives.
</p>

<p>
  My life is pretty busy because of my own choosing. My average weekday looks like such:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wake up, get ready, and commute: 6:00-7:00am
  </li>
  <li>
    Work and commute home: 7:00am-5:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Relax/hobbies: 5:30-7:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Training (preparation, session, cleanup): 7:30-9:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    To-do items and miscellaneous: 9:30-11:00pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep preparation: 11:00-11:30pm
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep: 11:30pm-6:00am
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sometimes I get off work around 4:00pm, sometimes I don't have many hobbies to do, sometimes my training sessions last 1:30 hr or even 2:30 hr, sometimes I have to finish up extra work in addition to my to-do items. Life comes down to <a href="../thoughts/priorities.html">priorities</a> and I seem to have too many, but none that I'm willing to give up. This leads to sleep going onto the chopping block.
</p>

<p>
  I've also (probably) bought too far in to the "sleeping in is wasting the day" mindset many people hold. I still believe in this: getting 10-12 hours of sleep <i>is</i> wasting the hours one could be awake experiencing the world and all it has to offer. However, that doesn't lead to the conclusion that sleep duration should be minimized as much as possible while still maintaining some semblance of sanity and motor functions. MacAskill's <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping">The philosophical case against oversleeping</a> does an excellent job of summing up my thoughts, but I took it an extra step and ignored her point about getting the sleep one needs, because need and <i>need</i> are two different things.
</p>

<p>
  So why write this post? Two reasons.
</p>

<p>
  First, I feel like my cognitive abilities have declined over the past year, and in reviewing my sleep logs, it follows a general lack of sleep. I occasionally have brain fog at work when someone asks me a question and I can't think of the answer. I miss what I think are grossly obvious observations or notes (I think this is more of a answer-being-obvious-after-being-shown type of effect, but who really knows). If I can get a better idea of the positive and negative effects of sleep and lack of sleep, respectively, then the part of me that stays up late may be more amenable to getting to bed early.
</p>

<p>
  Second, and as a result of the first reason, my aerobic and strength training will almost certainly improve with more sleep.

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<h3 id="benefits_basic">Basic Benefits</h3>

<p>
  A list of unresearched, general benefits from improving my sleep (in rough order of personal importance):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    My aerobic and strength training will improve due to better recovery
  </li>
  <li>
    My mind will be sharper and my thinking more clear
  </li>
  <li>
    I will physically feel better both upon waking up and throughout the day
  </li>
  <li>
    I will spend more time dreaming
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hygiene">Sleep Hygiene</h2>

<p>
  Sleep hygiene is not as well-known as it probably should be given its impact on sleep quality. Sleep is not entirely about quantity, but also quality, which is based on sleep hygiene practices. Here I explore common sleep hygiene suggestions' purpose and effectiveness. All subsections are stated as the suggestion, e.g., "Not Eating Before Bed" means the best sleep hygiene practice is to not eat before bed. Each section has practical suggestions at the end.
</p>

<p>
  The following are ordered from I determined to be most to least important.
</p>

<h3 id="hygiene_eating">Not Eating/Drinking Before Bed</h3>

<p>
  The type of food/drink absolutely matters. Low-calorie consumption is mostly fine. Foods/drinks with caffeine, such as chocolate or coffee, can cause one to wake up during the night or even prevent them from falling asleep altogether, leading to less sleep and their sleep schedule being disrupted. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/adenosine-and-sleep#:~:text=An%20increase%20in%20adenosine%20increases,stronger%20their%20sleep%20drive%20becomes.">Caffeine blocks adenosine</a>, which increases the need for sleep.
</p>

<p>
  There is a hypothesis that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, an amino acid present in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-tryptophan#">milk and meats, among other foods</a>, induces sleepiness. This is largely considered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial_somnolence#Turkey_and_tryptophan">myth</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Some highlights from Kinsey and Ormsbee's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425165/">The Health Impact of Nighttime Eating: Old and New Perspectives</a> (<a href="https://github.com/210ethan/210ethan.github.io/blob/master/knowledge/media/sleep/The%20Health%20Impact%20of%20Nighttime%20Eating%20Old%20and%20New%20Perspectives.pdf">annotated PDF</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
  studies in free-living healthy adults have shown that meal satiety also varies with time of day and that food intake during the night is less satiating and leads to greater daily caloric intake compared to food consumed in the morning hours
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  data is beginning to mount to suggest that this finding is not consistent if the food choice is altered to favor small, nutrient-dense, low energy foods and/or single macronutrients (<200 kcals)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Compared to the placebo group, those receiving the casein before sleep had higher plasma essential amino acid concentrations indicating that protein ingestion before sleep was effectively digested and absorbed. The increase in amino acid availability translated to higher whole-body and muscle protein synthesis rates (~22%, Figure 1A) and a net positive protein balance during the overnight period in the group receiving protein compared to the placebo control [52].
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  the data suggest that it may be advantageous for active individuals to consume a small, nutrient dense, high protein beverage (~150 kcals) before bed [47,52]. It is plausible to hypothesize that acute enhancements in overnight muscle protein synthesis and next morning resting metabolism may further aid in the maintenance of and/or improvement in body composition and thereby provide a competitive advantage in healthy, physically active individuals
</blockquote>

<p>
  Sadly, this focuses more on health impacts (I know it's the title) than sleep impacts, but is still extremely useful. I could not find literature on the impact of nighttime eating and sleep quality that didn't focus on a certain population.
</p>

<h4>Suggestions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do not eat within three hours of bedtime. If this must be violated, ensure it is easily digestible and does not contain any stimulants (sugar, caffeine, etc).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hygiene_light">Avoid Blue Light + Absorb Red Light</h3>

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12970330/






<h4>Suggestions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install warm light bulbs in the bedroom
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn on Night Shift or equivalent on electronics within two hours of bed
  </li>
  <li>
    Minimize or altogether eliminate electronics an hour before bed
  </li>
</ul>
