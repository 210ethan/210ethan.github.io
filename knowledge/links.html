    <a href="http://station515.com/home/">home</a>: The role environment plays in all journeys. It's important to surround oneself with people and things that raise all; it's important to avoid those that detract from a goal's progress. [!philosophy, !thoughts]
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        if your actions are not in line with your desires – examine your environment. what is it asking of you? what behaviors is it rewarding? accept that when you are tired and hungry and scared that you will do what is easiest, and find a way to make what is easiest also what is correct. use that 3pm energy to set the stage. make it beautiful. make it echo and nurture your desires. because it effects you. it affects you. accepting that will at least allow you to use it to your advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        too often people see “change your environment” as move to a different one. while this is sometimes needed, how often do people simply recreate the same mess in a new place? yes, there is occasionally toxicity that must be left – but if that toxicity is your own mess, there may be value in at least trying to clean it up. there is also power in creation. in molding an environment for a purpose. to sit in a space with ethos. with soul. and an objective.

    <blockquote>
      As long as most scientists can manage to accept definite, unmistakable, unambiguous experimental evidence, science can progress.  It may happen too slowly—it may take longer than it should—you may have to wait for a generation of elders to die out—but eventually, the ratchet of knowledge clicks forward another notch.  Year by year, decade by decade, the wheel turns forward.  It's enough to support a civilization. So that's all that Science really asks of you—the ability to accept reality when you're beat over the head with it.  It's not much, but it's enough to sustain a scientific culture.

      The Myth of the Lone Genius is a bullshit cliche and we would do well to stop parroting it to young people like it is some deep insight into the nature of innovation.

      I love capturing the little moments of daily life that happen at street level as I'm wandering around a city, whether it's a new one an ocean away or my own neighborhood in San Francisco. These are very different from the photos of the Eiffel Tower that every visitor to Paris has somewhere in their phone camera, different from the ones you'll find on travel guides or city government websites. You can't easily find the pictures I want on Google Images. I've yet to find a consistent good source of photos capturing exactly what it is that I find interesting on a city street, the sort of thing that I want to include in my City Reviews exploring the effects of infrastructure, culture, geography, and history on the day-to-day life of people living in that place. The only alternative is to capture them myself.

    <blockquote>
      Summarizing our previous arguments, we may conclude with a few broad generalizations. Evolutionary progress of the species has not been perceptible within historical times and may, for all practical purposes of record of prophecy, be left out of account as non-existent. Uninheritable progress, due to tradition, has genuinely taken place in the realism of science and technology, where each worker stands on the shoulders of his predecessors. In the realm of morals, the refinement of traditional codes may lead to a certain ethical progress throughout a whole society. But the greater part of what is called moral progress consists merely in changes that are entirely without ameliorative direction. Progress in the arts is very limited and, as soon as the technique of artistic expression is perfected, ceases altogether to exist. Every artists starts from the beginning and depends for success on his personal talents alone. Something analogous is true of religion. Even in the material world the idea of progress is untenable. We are today very rich because we are living on our cosmic capital. When that capital is exhausted, mankind will be bankrupt. Nothing could be more obvious.

    <blockquote>
      The main symptom is that, in the moment, acting upon your desires never feels urgent. It never feels important, and can be put off. Or it never feels possible, the problem just feels like a fact of life. And so a solution must center on solving the problem in the moment. And the solution that worked for me, is to make it part of your identity to be an agent. Make it a point of principle to do things, not because the thing is necessarily the perfect action, but because I choose the life where I do things, over the life where I always wait for the perfect opportunity.

When I'm in a good mood, I like to think it's because I have something helpful to say about these topics.

      The most appealing daily schedule I know is that of a turn-of-the-century Danish aristocrat. He got up at four and set out on foot to hunt black grouse, wood grouse, woodcock, and snipe. At eleven he met his friends, who had also been out hunting alone all morning. They converged “at one of these babbling brooks,” he wrote. He outlined the rest of his schedule. “Take a quick dip, relax with a schnapps and a sandwich, stretch out, have a smoke, take a nap or just rest, and then sit around and chat until three. Then I hunt some more until sundown, bathe again, put on white tie and tails to keep up appearances, eat a huge dinner, smoke a cigar and sleep like a log until the sun comes up again to redden the eastern sky. This is living…. Could it be more perfect?”

      If we want to raise healthy, high-agency children, we should give them the freedom to make decisions without removing them from the consequences of those decisions. Giving children agency now will help them avoid a dark cycle of work, pain, and reckless release in the future. Even if a life of indulgent hedonism is fun in the short-term, it ultimately leaves a void in the heart.

    <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RrCjPMKi8fpfGZ2cu">Logan Strohl on exercise norms</a>: A lot of statements I agree with here. [!philosophy, !thoughts]
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Being difficult is part of the very nature of exercise; you don't get physically stronger or gain physical endurance unless you work hard enough to be uncomfortable, and you don't improve meaningfully in these ways unless you are uncomfortable over and over again frequently and consistently. So I think sentiments like "it doesn't really matter, only do it if it's easy and you like it" (which rarely pop up in those words but I think are nevertheless subtly pervasive in nerdier subcultures) are especially detrimental to exercise in particular. And that's why I do sometimes bother to promote exercise explicitly.
      </p>
      <p>
        but it's also at least a little annoying and frustrating. because yeah, i almost certainly do have a genetic predisposition to be coordinated and so forth; but also, i started gymnastics training when i was in preschool, and every single year since then i've practiced some combination of gymnastics, soccer, dance, yoga, martial arts, running, weight lifting, swimming, cycling, hiking, and a smattering of more niche activities that require and develop physical skill. it's not like i just woke one morning able to do backflips. i did not roll a natural twenty on "core stability". i've worked hard for it my entire life, and that's important to me.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    Including some good comments:
    <blockquote>
      "You'll feel so much better" and "it's healthy" were the main reasons I was told to start exercising. I guess that's true, but after lifting for 7 years consistently, the main thing I noticed that no one told me was "you'll gain this superpower of every social interaction being a bit tilted more in your favor". Getting a good haircut for the first time ever probably helped too. The difference in how I'm listened to and treated is clear - people are much more interested in what I have to say.

      Life is full of cycles, great and small. Personal development is linked to lasting change. We pass through various stages, some achieved consciously, others reached accidentally. Daniel Levinson proposes that one's life cycle is composed of four 25-year eras. Confucious argued for six cycles. Aristotle thought there were three stages. The details don't much matter only that we change over the course of our lives and—sometimes—we have the opportunity to direct that change. At other times life appears simply "to happen" and we find ourselves on a different road, or continent.

    <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation">Document 9: A ChinaFile Translation</a>: Document 9 is a leaked report by the Chinese government detailing the seven problems modern-day China faces in the ideological sphere:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Promoting Western Constitutional Democracy: An attempt to undermine the current leadership and the socialism with Chinese characteristics system of governance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting “universal values” in an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of the Party’s leadership.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting civil society in an attempt to dismantle the ruling party’s social foundation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting Neoliberalism, attempting to change China’s Basic Economic System.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting the West’s idea of journalism, challenging China’s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to Party discipline.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting historical nihilism, trying to undermine the history of the CCP and of New China.
      </li>
      <li>
        Questioning Reform and Opening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
      </li>
    </ol>
    The government calling these problems is not surprising by any stretch. Their solution to prevent these from occurring has four legs:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Strengthen leadership in the ideological sphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Guide our party member and leaders to distinguish between true and false theories.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unwavering adherence to the principle of the Party’s control of media.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conscientiously strengthen management of the ideological battlefield.

      This provides time for reflection. To understand, deep in my own body, that to suffer is to grow. To try things that are deeply frightening, and to fail wisely and come back again and again until I succeed. That defines one possible (and proven) channel for growth and the goal of growth is nothing less than knowing yourself. Not the self that is uncovered, excavated, but a self that is molded by your very own trials and tribulations.

The smoke from an ordinary wood fire contains hundreds of compounds known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and irritating to the respiratory system. Most of the particles generated by burning wood are smaller than one micron—a size believed to be most damaging to our lungs. In fact, these particles are so fine that they can evade our mucociliary defenses and travel directly into the bloodstream, posing a risk to the heart. Particles this size also resist gravitational settling, remaining airborne for weeks at a time.

    <blockquote>
      As for mealtimes, few people in northern Europe ate breakfast in 1501. The medieval two-meal rhythm of the day persisted: dinner was at about 11 a.m. and supper at about 5 p.m. But as more people moved into towns, and made their living by working long hours for other townsmen, the time at which they could have supper was pushed back into the evening. This meant that dinner, the main meal of the day, had to be eaten a couple of hours later and became lunch. It followed that you had to eat an early meal, breakfast, in order to get through to lunchtime. School also helped bring about this change, for more and more boys went to school, and the long lessons required that they eat breakfast. Hence breakfast was ubiquitous in towns by 1600.

Calculating the value of your time, even very roughly, will let you make good trade-offs whether you’re buying time or paying with time. Pay now (cash) and consume later (memories) just make sure not to overestimate the time you’ll spend reminiscing and the amount of suffering you’ll have to pay. Invest in others, but don’t confuse the warm feeling of treating a friend with the ethical imperative to make the world a better place.

That said at the deepest level she is still in the public eye, the “athlete thing” is an experience, and whether a blessing or an inconvenience she handles her role positively. At its heart, the energy she expresses with her vineyard and the process by which she learned to grow, harvest, and bottle her own wine is the same energy you may see her sink into the winning stride of a silly fitness competition: it was effort, toil, and joy, and whether she loses or tastes a blended red that exceeds her expectations, her eyes crease and her smile requires no explanation.

    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053484/">Good sleep, bad sleep! The role of daytime naps in healthy adults</a>: [!health]
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Several investigators observed that short naps of less than 30 min duration had an invigorating effect, helped to maintain daytime arousal levels and enhanced performance...Moreover, short daytime naps were also reported to improve the emotional state. Even habitual nappers have been reported to benefit from naps
      </p>
      <p>
        Naps of less than 10 min duration have few if any benefit, whereas naps of between 10 and 45 min have restorative effects that last throughout the rest of the day...The body and mind thus need to be trained to take short naps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The optimum time for a nap is in the afternoon around 15:00 hours [3:00pm]. Daytime naps during the afternoon may have a biological basis, as daytime arousal levels have been shown to decline around this time
      </p>
      <p>
        Daytime naps are associated with sleep inertia after the patient awakens. Sleep inertia results in impaired alertness and performance for approximately 30 min after awakening from a nap, and slows the speed of cognitive tasks, but has few effects on the accuracy of task performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another concern about daytime naps is that they could diminish the quality of subsequent sleep at night [23,24]; however, there is little evidence to support this concern. Most investigators have not found daytime naps to affect nighttime sleep adversely.

    <a href="https://navymedicine.navylive.dodlive.mil/archives/1443">A Lollipop That Isn't Candy</a>: Fentanyl is now in a lollipop form (only available to the military). I've seen a video or picture (can't remember) of some SF team administering it to one of their members. A few benefits:
    <blockquote>
      Unlike morphine which takes 15 to 20 minutes to relieve pain, the lollipop is effective within five minutes. It’s also much easier to administer than morphine, which must be injected into a large muscle, and if the dosage is too strong the lollipop can be rapidly removed. The effects of morphine cannot be halted.

    <blockquote>
      First, an independent lab should store blood and urine samples from all major league players annually and test these samples (using the latest detection techniques) at 10-, 20- and 30-year intervals following each player's retirement. Second, all players should be paid over a 30-year period. Third, if any player's blood tests positive for performance enhancing drugs, that player will forfeit his remaining salary and pension and will be banned from baseball for life.
    </blockquote>
    I especially like last part and have advocated (amongst my friends) for this to be implemented in track and cycling, along with forfeiture of their sponsorships. These athletes' livelihood is dependent on their participating in major events. The risk of this being rescinded is significantly greater than the "risk" of not using PEDs and performing poorly. Sadly, I think PEDs increase the excitement of events, as the athletes are playing at higher levels. [!culture]

      There was an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them, and a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued. Police used more than ten thousand rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound (0.5 kg) bombs (which the police referred to as "entry devices") made of FBI-supplied Tovex, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The ensuing fire killed eleven of the people in the house (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13). The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately sixty-five nearby houses. Although firefighters had earlier drenched the building prior to the bombing, after the fire broke out, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, so held them back.

        When you're feeling depressed for no good reason, force yourself to laugh. It triggers happiness almost as well as externally-induced laughter. Eventually, you will noticeably condition yourself to release seratonin (or endorphins, or something) every time you notice that you're seratonin-deficient. It's been effective for me. I started it as a moody teenager and it quickly became self-perpetuating. Google suggests I'm not alone. It's got a whiff of wire-heading, I admit, but ideally you're using it to solve a brain chemistry defect, not an external problem.

      The eye is not a single frame snapshot camera. It is more like a video stream. The eye moves rapidly in small angular amounts and continually updates the image in one's brain to "paint" the detail. We also have two eyes, and our brains combine the signals to increase the resolution further. We also typically move our eyes around the scene to gather more information. Because of these factors, the eye plus brain assembles a higher resolution image than possible with the number of photoreceptors in the retina. So the megapixel equivalent numbers below refer to the spatial detail in an image that would be required to show what the human eye could see when you view a scene.

        routine is the enemy of slow subjective time. It will speed up subjective time enormously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Novelty is what slows time down, and a routine is an engine for eliminating the unexpected, thereby eliminating novelty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Novelty makes the human brain pay attention. Something novel is something potentially life-changing, in both good and bad ways. Full focus, aliveness to the present moment and unusually clear memory all kick in when paying attention to something novel.

      It’s essential to replenish your physical and emotional energy, along with your capacity to focus, by prioritizing good sleep habits, nutrition, exercise, social connection, and practices that promote equanimity and well-being, like meditating, journaling, and enjoying nature.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      What aspects of your situation are truly fixed, and which can you change? Altering your perspective can buffer the negative impact of even the inflexible aspects. If exhaustion is a key problem, ask yourself which tasks—including critical ones—you could delegate to free up meaningful time and energy for other important work. Are there ways to reshape your job in order to gain more control or to focus on the most fulfilling tasks?
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Reduce exposure to job stressors. You’ll also need to target high-value activities and relationships that still trigger unhealthy stress. This involves resetting the expectations of colleagues, clients, and even family members for what and how much you’re willing to take on, as well as ground rules for working together. You may get pushback. But doubters must know that you’re making these changes to improve your long-term productivity and protect your health.

      There is also lots of anecdotal support for the large variation between programmers. During the time I was at Boeing in the mid 1980s, there was a project that had about 80 programmers working on it that was at risk of missing a critical deadline. The project was critical to Boeing, and so they moved most of the 80 people off that project and brought in one guy who finished all the coding and delivered the software on time. I didn’t work on that project, and I didn’t know the guy, so I’m not 100% sure the story is even true. But I heard the story from someone I trusted, and it seemed true at the time.

This is contradictory to what many believe. Notes: [!science, !psychology, !culture]
    <blockquote>
      Whereas near transfer – i.e., the transfer of skills within the same domain – is sometimes observed, far transfer – i.e., the transfer of skills across two distant domains – is rare or possibly inexistent (Melby-Lervåg, Redick, & Hulme, 2016, Sala et al., 2019a). Moreover, when it does occur, transfer of skills is often limited to the degree to which the two domains (source and target) share contents...performance significantly worsens when experts engage in certain subspecialties of their field of expertise.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      they claim that it is possible to induce far transfer by engaging in domain-specific cognitively demand ing activities that boost domain-general cognitive skills...At a neural level, this generalization is thought to be enabled by the activation of shared brain structures that are common to the practiced activity (e.g., music) and other core cognitive skills (e.g., fluid intelligence, working memory, and language;
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The overall impact of music training programs on cognitive and academic outcomes is weak and moderately heterogeneous (gbar = 0.184, SE = 0.041, tau<sup>2</sup> = 0.041, I<sup>2</sup> = 43.16%)...inverse relationship between the studies’ design quality and magnitude of the effect sizes. Conversely, a small overall effect size is observed in those studies employing neither active controls nor random assignment (gbar = 0.246).

      these results indicate that music training fails to produce solid improvements in all the examined cognitive and academic skills equally

Structured homeschool had the best results, while unstructured had the worst. The involvement and role of the parents plays a significant role. I find this easy to believe based on my experience with homeschooled students. I know three boys whose father is a university professor and department chair of a well-known private university. All three of his kids are well-behaved, intelligent, and high-achieving. On the other spectrum, I know other homeschooled students whose skills aren't nearly as strong as the three boys. What some don't consider is the social learning that takes place in public school. Students are exposed to a wide variety of backgrounds in public school (provided they live in a relatively diverse area). This is challenging to replicate in a homeschool setting. Co-ops are an option, but it is unlikely the same amount of diversity would be achieved. [!culture, !psychology]

        Keep emails as concise as possible without losing information. Ex: "I was able to look through my schedule and found a few openings for the following times: [times] If you're not available then I am also available these times. Let me know what works for you and I will make myself available" can easily be changed to "I am available these times: [times]. Let me know what works".

      <p>
        Redistributing speaking time to quieter people when group conversations become lopsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being more vocal at work: speaking up more in meetings, writing more thorough documentation, leaving more detailed comments in code reviews, and sharing links that are relevant to company projects in the #random Slack channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participating more actively on Twitter. This means writing more Tweets of my own, responding more frequently to others, and being more liberal in my use of the ‘like’ button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing more blog posts. Writing takes a lot of work, and more often than not, what I write doesn’t bring me much recognition. But occasionally I hear a word or two of thanks for sharing an idea that helped or stimulated someone, and this is enough to convince me that my efforts are worthwhile.

Overall good points, but actually implementing these ideas (at least the ones requiring physical changes, like raised streets) in current cities will be quite the hassle.

      Let’s take all these things together: In a world where you can get cheap housing in or quite close to a massive hub of culture. A world where all shipments and returns are cheaper and faster, where you can order food from anywhere quickly for no cost, where you can travel anywhere in the city with exceptional speed. A world where all the streets have shade and no cars, there’s considerably less pollution, and the view is amazing even in the densest sections.

I am a firm believer that if someone can't make the climb unassisted (as in carrying all their own gear, not necessarily finding the way), they shouldn't be doing it. It puts the guides and any rescue personnel in dangerous positions, all because the climber was too proud (read: stupid) or stupid to turn around. The so-called suggestions, which should be considered commands, put in place are formed by world-class climbers: start early, retreat by 12:00pm, etc. The risk is just not worth the reward.

Sadly, safety measures have not been universally implemented due to "a powerful auto manufacturers’ lobby". The attitude of "this couldn't happen to me" prevails and surely causes many deaths. But should they be prosecuted? None of the parents showed any intent whatsoever—it was a lapse of memory while focusing on other important aspects of their life. Anything can happen to anybody (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a>) and those vulnerable should prepare for the worst.

    <a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/27840/">How Not to Talk to Your Kids</a>: Being praised for being "smart" doesn't necessarily help. Bronson reviews literature that discusses this idea, and gives examples of other children, including their own, that have both suffered and improved with different types of praise. A few takeaways: 1) Effort should be praised, as intelligence generally follows effort (my studying hard for an exam will increase my knowledge for that exam), but not vice versa. 2) Be specific in praise. Saying "great job!" is ambiguous and doesn't give the child a certain behavior to continue. Instead, saying "great job figuring out why that first approach on your math homework didn't work!" is much better. 3) Let kids fail. Some people I knew in high school who never failed did very poorly on their first exam in university, resulting in tears and a self-existential crisis never before seen. What's important is learning from failure (how, why) and learning how to recover from it. [!psychology]

I see myself in her during my time at AggieFab. I would answer emails as soon as I got them (although it was more just one of my quirks, I hate seeing an unread message). I would stay late and go in on weekends to help students with issues. I was soon feeling occasionally burnt out, but it fluctuated. Some nights I would go to bed giddy with excitement at the following day's work, while other days I would slog through my tasks for the day. I am a firm believer that no one can work more than 60-70 hours per week without feeling <i>some</i> degree of burnout. Being conservative in your time commitment and setting strict rules for yourself (e.g., no bringing work home) can help ward burnout off for some time. [!productivity, !culture]

Small towns that are discovered and subsequently touted for their beauty and uniqueness can have their cultures destroyed by tourism; what was once truly a small town now grows to meet the tourism demand, changing the feel entirely. While the food or scenery may still be the same, it's just not the same as it once was. So I say go off the beaten path. If Yelp or another website tells you to go there, don't. Go explore and see if you can find your own small town that has yet to be discovered by the roving masses looking and don't tell <i>anybody</i> about it. [!culture]

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22662107">Incentives in publication and online comments</a>: "Why make one 10x effort paper when you will serve your interests much better and with lower risks making 10 1x effort papers?" After all, the 10 1x papers will still be accepted and people will likely enjoy the work, while the one 10x paper will only have a marginally-greater impact, i.e., people won't notice you put in 10x the effort. PhD students often have publication requirements set by their professor: publish X papers and I'll let you graduate. While this is one measure of progress, it fails to include quality in that measure. One of my professors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Dougherty">Dr. Edward Dougherty</a>, is a big advocate of good science. I once heard him freely describe a student's paper as "steaming garbage" (or something to that effect). He believes to put out a truly decent paper on cancer takes many years, not the 1-2 that most papers nowadays get finished in. And yet those who produce more papers are viewed as higher value to potential employers, academia or industry. The current structure of publication incentive should change. I'm not sure to what or how to go about doing so, but the amount of poor papers published in poor journals with poor reviewers only discourages quality science from happening. (All this is not to say that all papers which are produced in a short time period are poor.)

For example, a relative of mine is an excellent poker player: he entered in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_of_Poker">World Series of Poker</a> and made it past the first two rounds. To get this good, he read a book, took notes, interviewed players, read another book, and kept practicing in his free time. That's it.

    <a href="https://narratively.com/the-man-with-the-golden-airline-ticket/">The Man with the Golden Airline Ticket</a>: The story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAirpass">American Airlines AAirpass</a> and Steven Rothstein's experience using it. For just $250,000, the cardholder can fly an unlimited amount of miles for as long as they live—no catch. For an extra $150,000, the cardholder can add a travel companion with the same privileges. AA grossly underestimated Rothstein's yearly travel, eventually finding a loophole in the terms and conditions to revoke his pass due to so-called fraudulent behavior (Rothstein would offer strangers to be his designated companion, leaving AA out of one ticket—this added up).
