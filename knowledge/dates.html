<h1 id="dates">Dates</h1>

<p>
  Out-of-the-box options for both committed relationships and casual partners.
</p>

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of dates is two-fold depending on where the relationship stands: to get to know the other person and to have fun. The latter is always a reason, whereas the former becomes less important the better you get to know the person.
</p>

<p>
  Going to dinner helps getting to know the other person, but isn't necessarily that much fun compared to other options. Going to a live event or similar is fun, but unless you make a point to talk before or after (during isn't always an option), they won't be much less of a mystery afterwards. Shared experiences, especially memorable ones (fun, exciting, embarrassing, traumatic), strengthen relationships the most.
</p>

<p>
  So here we stand. The below list are date ideas I've come up with myself or gotten from others (sources included as applicable).
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="list">The List</h2>

<p>
  In no particular order.
</p>

<h3 id="blind_dinner">Blind Dinner</h3>

<p>
  Option 1 is to find a place intentionally serving a blind dinner where all guests are blinded. These generally cost a pretty penny.
</p>

<p>
  Option 2 is to call ahead to a place and explain to them your intention, ask them to choose a few items for you, then show up and put the blindfolds on. This requires significant trust and ability to withstand social judgment.
</p>

<p>
  Option 3 is unilateral: one partner makes the meal while the other is blindfolded.
</p>

<h3 id="blind">Blind Taste Tests</h3>

<p>
  Try different food and drink while blindfolded and see if they can be distinguished.
</p>

<p>
  Options include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Impossible burger vs. regular burger
  </li>
  <li>
    High-quality meat vs. low-quality meat
  </li>
  <li>
    Expensive wine vs. cheap wine
  </li>
  <li>
    Chick-fil-A sandwich vs. McDonald's sandwich
  </li>
  <li>
    Chain pizza vs. gourmet pizza
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fort">Fort</h3>

<p>
  Build a fort using sheets, furniture, and pillows. Set it up by itself or next to a TV for movies. It's extra fun if it starts immediately as you open the door and have to go all the way through it from the get-go. Include plenty of snacks and drinks.

    Create a poem, map, or list of hints for where to find the items:

</p>

<h3 id="tiffany">A Day with Tiffany</h3>

<p>
  Inspired by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054698/">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a>, compile a list of things neither person has ever done before, then spend the whole day doing those things.

</p>

<h3 id="paddleboardkayak">Paddleboarding/Kayaking</h3>

  Grab a buoyant cooler, fill it with drinks and snacks, and take a paddleboard or kayak out onto (calm) water. Hop in the water if it's hot out and enjoy the cold drinks and delicious snacks.
</p>

<h3 id="urbex">Urban Exploration</h3>

<p>
  Sneak into abandoned buildings or construction sites and explore.
</p>

<h3 id="geocaching">Geocaching</h3>

<p>
  Go look for caches in the area. They shouldn't be too hard to find else it just becomes annoying to keep looking and coming up empty-handed. Obviously avoid remote caches if the relationship is in its infancy.
</p>

<h3 id="yoga">Fun Yoga</h3>

<p>
  Find a hot yoga or goat yoga class in the area. Warning: hot yoga gets you sweaty as heck and this may be a massive turn off to the partner. Be careful!
</p>

<h3 id="hotones">Hot Ones</h3>

<p>
  Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ">Hot Ones</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>

    Order naked chicken wings from a restaurant or make them yourself
  </li>

    Enjoy! Have a nice conversation while suffering the burn or ask interview-style questions.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="paintsip">Paint and Sip</h3>

<p>
  One person should supply all the painting materials: canvas, watercolors, palette, brushes. The other person should supply the edibles: wine or beer and, if hungry, charcuterie materials. Both should wear clothes they don't mind getting dirty.
</p>

<p>
  Put on a YouTube painting tutorial (shoutout Bob Ross) or just freehand it and see what masterpieces (or ugly creations, depending on how much alcohol has been consumed) result.
</p>

<h3 id="shelter">Shelter Dog Walking</h3>

<p>
  Animals shelters often allow their dogs to be walked for free. Good exercise, good sunlight, and good karma!
</p>

<h3 id="cookingclass">Cooking Class</h3>

<p>
  Cooking together is both fun and a good learning experience, especially when taken with an experienced instructor. Search for local cooking classes that offer foods both people like.
</p>

<p>
  If you live in a city with an Eataly, they offer date night pasta making classes.
</p>

<h3 id="mini">Mini Restaurant</h3>

<p>
  A home-based version of the <a href="#crawl">Food Crawl</a> that requires some amount of skill in the kitchen, cooking together is both fun and a good learning experience.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Choose a food that both people like, can be made in small quantities, and is relatively inexpensive—in cost, time, effort, and tools needed—to make. Good options include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Burgers
      </li>
      <li>
        Tacos
      </li>
      <li>
        Dessert
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a nice menu. Restaurant name is crucial here for owning it! I named mine Miniscules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide on the offerings. My burger restaurant offered:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don't Knock It Til ya Try It: Smash burger with peanut butter and jelly
      </li>
      <li>
        Aloha [city name]: Hawaiian roll with pineapple, teriyaki sauce, and sriracha mayo
      </li>
      <li>
        Cluck Cluck Oink Oink: Fried egg, guacamole, bacon, cheddar
      </li>
      <li>
        *Impossible burger available to accommodate for dietary restriction
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide if any drink pairings should be included. Wine, beer, cocktails, sparkling water, or tea are all good options depending on the cuisine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the food!
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pop-up">Pop-up Bars</h3>

<p>
  Cities sometimes offer holiday-themed (Halloween, Christmas, etc) pop-up bars with special drinks and decor. Don the appropriate attire (dress up in Halloween costumes, wear ugly Christmas sweaters) and head to one. This can also be turned into a (pop-up) bar crawl.
</p>

<h3 id="crawl">Food Crawl</h3>

<p>
  Trying different offerings of the same dish is fun. Different restaurants offer different takes on the same entree and provide different atmospheres to enjoy them in.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Choose a food that both people like and is easily shareable. Good options include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Burgers
      </li>
      <li>
        Sushi
      </li>
      <li>
        Pizza
      </li>
      <li>
        Tacos
      </li>
      <li>
        Dessert (smaller portions required)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find a place within the city that is easily walkable
  </li>
  <li>
    Find multiple (two or three) restaurants that are within the area
  </li>
  <li>
    Make reservations (as needed and available) at each
    <ul>
      <li>
        One hour or slightly less per restaurant is good probably fine
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Eat at place1, walk to place2, eat at place2, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Alternate who chooses the option at each place or agree together
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="airport">Airport</h3>

<p>
  This only works if there is free access to a credit card lounge (like the <a href="https://capitalonetravel.com/lounges">Capital One lounges</a>) and a guest can be let in. Simply purchase two of the cheapest one-way tickets that can be found, park, get past security, and enjoy the free food and drinks. If you're lucky enough to have access to the DFW CO lounge, there is a perfect view of the sunset!
</p>

<p>
  For added fun, each person should dress as they normally do to the airport, but don't tell the other person what you're wearing.
</p>

<h3 id="crime">True Crime</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ozy.com/good-sht/why-true-crime-is-podcast-crack-for-women/94331/">Women love true crime</a>. They also love a good date. Why not combine the two?
</p>

<p>
  Find a true crime podcast for both people to listen to prior to the date and discuss it. For unsolved cases, come up with the craziest and most plausible theories.
</p>

<h3 id="picnic">Nostalgic Picnic</h3>

<p>
  Each person should bring one or two foods and one drink that distinctly remind them of their childhood. Ideally this is something unique (e.g., bananas rolled in fruity pebbles) and not something boring like PB&J.
</p>

<h3 id="dance">Dance Class</h3>

<p>
  Go visit a dance class. This can vary from ballroom to salsa to hip-hop and everything in between.
