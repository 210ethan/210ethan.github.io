<p>
  The purpose of dates is two-fold depending on where the relationship stands: to get to know the other person and to have fun. The latter is always a reason, whereas the former becomes less important the better you get to know the person.
</p>

<p>
  Going to dinner helps getting to know the other person, but isn't necessarily that much fun compared to other options. Going to a live event or similar is fun, but unless you make a point to talk before or after (during isn't always an option), they won't be much less of a mystery afterwards.
</p>

<p>
  So here we stand. The below list are date ideas I've come up with myself or gotten from others.

<h2 id="list">The List</h2>

<h3 id="airport">Airport</h3>

<p>
  This only works if there is free access to a credit card lounge (like the <a href="https://capitalonetravel.com/lounges">Capital One lounges</a>) and a guest can be let in. Simply purchase two of the cheapest one-way tickets that can be found, park, get past security, and enjoy the free food and drinks. If you're lucky enough to have access to the DFW CO lounge, there is a perfect view of the sunset!
</p>

<h3 id="crime">True Crime</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.ozy.com/good-sht/why-true-crime-is-podcast-crack-for-women/94331/">Women love true crime</a>. They also love a good date. Why not combine the two?
</p>

<p>
  Find a true crime podcast for both parties to listen to prior to the date and discuss it. For unsolved cases, come up with the craziest and most plausible theories.
