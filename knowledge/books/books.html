<h1>Books</h1>

I am active on Goodreads (see my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ethan97">account here</a>). I try to review most of the books I read, but especially the non-fiction ones.







<h2>Favorite and Important Books</h2>

Favorite does not necessarily mean important, nor vice versa. I will define them as:
<ul>
  <li>Favorite: A book I thoroughly enjoyed.</li>
  <li>Important: A book I think everyone should read in their lifetime.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Favorites</h3>

A novel about a young, freshly-graduated officer who gets stationed in a remote outpost and spends all of his life waiting for the "big event" to happen (Tartars invading).

<h3>Important</h3>

      <li>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach">Gödel, Escher and Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a> by Douglas Hofstadter. Winner of the 1980 <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/223">Pulitzer Prize</a> and arguably one of the most important books ever written. Admittedly, my reading of it was not as thorough as it should have been (I was age 18 at the time) and I did not retain as much as I would have liked, but that does not diminish its significance. Eliezer Yudkowsky claims it as "<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/bookshelf.html#k_geb">the best and most beautiful book ever written</a>," and plenty of others resonate with that statement (see other Goodreads reviews).

<i>War and Peace</i> is often acclaimed as one of, if not the, <a href="https://thegreatestbooks.org/items/116">greatest novels of all-time</a>, as evident by the high-ranking and sheer number of "best book" lists it makes it on, including Bloom's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20941.The_Western_Canon?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=hsvns1hWJT&rank=1"><i>Western Canon</i></a>.

This claim is not an opinion, nor can it be argued, questioned, or debated—it just is, and only those who have read this masterpiece will be able to comprehend this fact.

Tolstoy explores a plethora (but not to excess) of themes through the perspective of five aristocratic Russian families and their relations during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>: Bolkónsky, Rostov, Bezúkhov, Kurágin, and Drubetskóy. And despite being written 150 years ago, these motifs still directly apply to 21st-century life. Past generations are often looked at differently than the current generation—the current gen'ers think their parents can't and don't and won't possibly understand what is going on, can't <i>possibly</i> put themselves in their position, can't feel what they are feeling—but how they are mistaken. Some experiences transcend the time period, the social status, the location that people think make them unique and unlike anybody else. Tolstoy recognizes this fact of life while looking back from the 1860s onto the 1800-1820s, masterfully discussing the bravery required during times of war; the passion one feels towards a lover both in and out of their presence; financial stress and its toll on mental and physical health; the concept of love, not just of a spouse, but of comrades, family members, and humanity in general; the difference between free will and consciousness and their role in contributing to history; teenage infatuation and mistaking it for love and allowing it to engulf your thoughts and body and actions and life and being, only to eventually to realize it's not what it was nor will it ever be that; the concept of being good and doing good for their intrinsic value, not for some underlying purpose; the desire for glory and fame amongst one's peers and countrymen and family and the fine line between courage and sheer recklessness in the attempt to achieve it; the sense of identity one feels with their nation and their people and their desire to contribute to and support that identity through the participation of war; the need for revenge after one has been wronged and the forgiveness that some choose to give towards the offender; the love of God and all His doings; the feeling of needing to take action, even when the event that the action is acting upon is already in motion and the action one proposes will serve little to no purpose except making them feel and look better; the facade of strength one puts on to ward off an enemy, despite being crippled internally; the concession of valuables in exchange for a later, but more valuable result; the standing up against a crowd for what one knows and believes is the right action, regardless of the difficulty of the decision.


[FINISH THEMES]




The final part (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm#link2H_4_0370">Epilogue Part Two</a> (note that this is not the Pevear-Vorohonsky translation, but the gist is understood))) is the most significant of all of the volumes and parts. Tolstoy discusses power, free will, and their role in shaping and driving history forward. After examining the former two, he asks and promptly answers the "two essential questions of history: (1) What is power? and (2) What force produces the movement of peoples?" In regards to power, "power is that relation of a certain person to other persons in which the person takes the less part in the action the more he expresses opinions, suppositions, and justifications for the jointly accomplished action." Tolstoy uses the standard military model to exemplify power—the commander-in-chief takes the least part of action and the most of expressing his opinion (giving orders), the generals have a bit more action and less opinion, and so on and so forth all the way down to the infantry, where they perform all the action and have little to no opinion in the grand scheme of things. In regards to the force, "the movement of peoples is produced, not by power, not by intellectual activity, not even by a combination of the two,...but by the activity of <i>all</i> the people taking part in the event and always joining together in such a way that those who take the greatest direct part in the event, take the least responsibility upon themselves, and vice versa." This definition is a bit opaque, allowing it to serve as a segue into the second part of Part Two: free will. Do humans truly have free will? is a question that has plagued philosophers since the beginning. We believe in and trust the natural laws that govern physical objects, e.g., gravity, but refuse to accept that man's will may be governed by a set of natural laws not seen or understood. [finish] [discuss causes of history and major events]

Tolstoy does not consider <i>War and Peace</i> a novel, nor an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry">epic</a>, nor a historical chronicle, nor really fit for any set genre of literature. Instead, it's in its own category altogether, mixing and refining a variety of literary genres to create the 1200+ page (translation-dependent) work.

Translations are a tricky and often controversial subject. Some readers swear by one translator, while others condemn that translator for their lack of accuracy and inability to convey the subtleties that author originally meant to express in the native version of the work. Pevear is a low-level Russian speaker and native English speaker and Volokhonsky is a native Russian speaker and high-level English speaker. (I can't find any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">CEFR results</a> from either Pevear or Volokhonsky, but based on interviews I've watched, she has a strong grasp of English and he has been said to be <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars">non-conversational</a> in Russian, implying some proficiency.) Together they have a comprehensive, close-to-foolproof method of translating. Volokhonsky goes through the novel's Russian version and translates it directly to English, along with notes about the author's intricate meanings and verbiage within the text: What did Tolstoy really mean by that? How does Dostoevsky's use of this specific phrase contribute to the atmosphere of the passage? Pevear then cleans up her direct translation into more fluid English. Volokhonsky checks his new-and-improved translation and they continue to refine it until the English version matches the Russian version in all details, such as tone, meaning, etc. This exchange of accuracy and nuance continues a few more times in either direction, until they are satisfied. Pevear then reads the newly-translated English version to Volokhonsky while she simultaneously reads the original Russian. This method is advantageous for two obvious reasons. First, there are native speakers of both languages checking the original and checking the translation, producing two checkpoints in which errors can be detected. The native part is crucial. Other translators, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Garnett">Garnett</a>, learned the from-language later in life (Garnett began learning Russian at the ripe age of 30), which many believe to be less efficient and effective than learning them as a child. (This has been refuted by some, but by-and-large remains true: I nor anyone in my close friend group know anyone who has learned another language past the age of 20 to the fluency required to make an accurate translation. And yet, most bilingual speakers learned their languages at a young age.) Garnett's late-learning shows in her criticisms by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GwfplQ3OK8EC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=nabokov+on+garnett+dry+and+flat&source=bl&ots=m7gEg1cnEk&sig=ACfU3U27zRicnxvo_yS8WSNSmfpuhjcM7w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid_rnrnpDpAhVJ-6wKHX8HA_sQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nabokov%20on%20garnett%20dry%20and%20flat&f=false">Nabokov</a>. Second, and an extension of the first, there are more checkpoints for errors to be detected. No first draft is ever perfect (Tolstoy is reported to have written seven drafts for <i>War and Peace</i>!), and both errors and improvements can be found when making multiple passes. With all this being said and while I suggest Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation, I encourage you to do your research on translations and choose the one you think is best.
