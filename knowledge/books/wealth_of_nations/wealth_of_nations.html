<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Written by Scottish economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_smith">Adam Smith</a> in 1776, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, often abbreviated simply to <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, is considered the beginning of classical economic theory.
</p>

<p>
  Smith spent 10 years writing <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and it shows. The book provides extreme detail and explanation of his arguments and delves into a variety of topics.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was well-received by many. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams">Samuel Adams</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_madison">James Madison</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_washington">George Washington</a>, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_marx">Karl Marx</a>,
</p>

<h2 id="book_one">Book One: Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour</h2>

<p>
  Smith's thesis of the first chapter is relatively simple:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "Division of labour is the great cause of its increased powers"
</blockquote>

<p>
  To exhibit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour">division of labour</a>, he uses the pin factory as an example. There are "about eighteen distinct operations" to making a pin, and the most efficient method is to have one individual per distinct operation (Smith concedes that sometimes one man may head multiple operations). This proves efficient for a two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The worker becomes better at his specific operation, whereas someone having to do multiple will only make marginal improvements to his craft.
  </li>
  <li>
    This improvement lends itself to more operations per unit time, increasing the output of the whole product. If the worker had to perform all 18 operations by himself, the product's output would greatly diminish.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This idea is similar to the modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line">assembly line</a>. Instead of having to work on multiple processes and spend valuable time transporting the product to and from sites, the line does the transporting and workers only focus on one operation.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson">Joan Robinson</a> refutes Smith's division of labour argument in her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4761085-an-introduction-to-modern-economics?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=a5AKIan1Cz&rank=1"><i>An Introduction to Modern Economics</i></a> by stating that a single worker can easily divide the 18 operations over 18 days to produce the same output as 18 different workers over one day. (See <a href="https://www.fresheconomicthinking.com/2015/06/adam-smiths-pin-factory-capital-vs.html">this post</a> by Dr. Cameron Murray for specific quotes.) This argument only makes sense over a long period of time. In the short-term, because a complete product only occurs after one full product cycle, Smith's original method of overlapping produces faster results. But as seen in the Robinson's method, product sets will be completed every day after Day 7, whereas with Smith the first complete set is finished on Day 4 and one will be completed every day thereafter.

<p>
  What Robinson's model does not account for is skilled labor, where a large degree of expertise is required for a specific area. Take semiconductor fabrication (creating computer chip from their elemental materials, like Si and Cu). There are four main processes: deposition, etching, modification, and patterning. Within these are hundreds of subprocesses and nuances that take years to learn, requiring a career specialization. There are many cases of engineers being in one process group for 20-30 years and <i>still</i> learning things about the process. With fields like this it is not worth it for the employee or employer to generalize their skills.
</p>

<p>
  Smith proposes three reasons as to why division of labour outputs so much more:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    "Increase of dexterity in every particular workman", or the improvement of the worker's skill. Smith uses the example of a <a href="https://www.tfcg.ca/nailer-old-occupation">nailer</a>. While a novice can make "eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day", while someone "who had never exercises any other trade but that of making nails ... could make upwards of two thousands three hundred nails in a day". This explanation is obvious: the more practice one gets at a skill, the more efficient and better they become, increasing the output per unit time.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Saving of the time which is commonly lost in the passing from one species of work to another". Using the pinmaker's example, for them to switch from operation to operation requires the worker to switch tools, clean up their workstation, etc., all losing precious time.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many". This is a key aspect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney">Eli Whitney</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin">cotton gin</a>, which efficiently removed seeds from cotton. "An individual would work 10 hours to separate a pound of fibers from seeds ... a team of two or three could then process 50 pounds of cotton in a single day [using the cotton gin]" (<a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/memagazineselect/article/131/09/54/443328/A-Turn-of-the-CrankThe-Cotton-Gin-was-a-Simple">source</a>). Assuming a "single day" is also 10 hours, this is a 16-25x (50/3 or 50/2) output increase.
