<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  Written by Scottish economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_smith">Adam Smith</a> in 1776, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, often abbreviated simply to <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, is considered the beginning of classical economic theory.
</p>

<p>
  Smith spent 10 years writing <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and it shows. The book provides extreme detail and explanation of his arguments and delves into a variety of topics.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was well-received by many. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams">Samuel Adams</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_madison">James Madison</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_washington">George Washington</a>, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_marx">Karl Marx</a>,
</p>

<h2 id="book_one">Book One: Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of labor</h2>

<p>
  Smith's thesis of the first chapter is relatively simple:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "Division of labor is the great cause of its increased powers"
</blockquote>

<p>
  To exhibit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor">division of labor</a>, he uses the pin factory as an example. There are "about eighteen distinct operations" to making a pin, and the most efficient method is to have one individual per distinct operation (Smith concedes that sometimes one man may head multiple operations). This proves efficient for a two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The worker becomes better at his specific operation, whereas someone having to do multiple will only make marginal improvements to his craft.
  </li>
  <li>
    This improvement lends itself to more operations per unit time, increasing the output of the whole product. If the worker had to perform all 18 operations by himself, the product's output would greatly diminish.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This idea is similar to the modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line">assembly line</a>. Instead of having to work on multiple processes and spend valuable time transporting the product to and from sites, the line does the transporting and workers only focus on one operation.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson">Joan Robinson</a> refutes Smith's division of labor argument in her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4761085-an-introduction-to-modern-economics?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=a5AKIan1Cz&rank=1"><i>An Introduction to Modern Economics</i></a> by stating that a single worker can easily divide the 18 operations over 18 days to produce the same output as 18 different workers over one day. (See <a href="https://www.fresheconomicthinking.com/2015/06/adam-smiths-pin-factory-capital-vs.html">this post</a> by Dr. Cameron Murray for specific quotes.) This argument only makes sense over a long period of time. In the short-term, because a complete product only occurs after one full product cycle, Smith's original method of overlapping produces faster results. But as seen in the Robinson's method, product sets will be completed every day after Day 7, whereas with Smith the first complete set is finished on Day 4 and one will be completed every day thereafter.

<p>
  What Robinson's model does not account for is skilled labor, where a large degree of expertise is required for a specific area. Take semiconductor fabrication (creating computer chip from their elemental materials, like Si and Cu). There are four main processes: deposition, etching, modification, and patterning. Within these are hundreds of subprocesses and nuances that take years to learn, requiring a career specialization. There are many cases of engineers being in one process group for 20-30 years and <i>still</i> learning things about the process. With fields like this it is not worth it for the employee or employer to generalize their skills.
</p>

<p>
  Smith proposes three reasons as to why division of labor outputs so much more:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    "Increase of dexterity in every particular workman", or the improvement of the worker's skill. Smith uses the example of a <a href="https://www.tfcg.ca/nailer-old-occupation">nailer</a>. While a novice can make "eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day", while someone "who had never exercises any other trade but that of making nails ... could make upwards of two thousands three hundred nails in a day". This explanation is obvious: the more practice one gets at a skill, the more efficient and better they become, increasing the output per unit time.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Saving of the time which is commonly lost in the passing from one species of work to another". Using the pinmaker's example, for them to switch from operation to operation requires the worker to switch tools, clean up their workstation, etc., all losing precious time.
  </li>
  <li>
    "Invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor, and enable one man to do the work of many". This is a key aspect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney">Eli Whitney</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin">cotton gin</a>, which efficiently removed seeds from cotton. "An individual would work 10 hours to separate a pound of fibers from seeds ... a team of two or three could then process 50 pounds of cotton in a single day [using the cotton gin]" (<a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/memagazineselect/article/131/09/54/443328/A-Turn-of-the-CrankThe-Cotton-Gin-was-a-Simple">source</a>). Assuming a "single day" is also 10 hours, this is a 16-25x (50/3 or 50/2) output increase.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Division of labor is limited by the "extent of the market", or, put mathematically, the number of positions divided by the working population. If the quotient is greater than 1, then at least one individual will have to fill two roles in his community. If less than 1, at least one position will have two individuals filling it (whether working together or against each other in competition). Smith uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> as an example:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "In the lone houses and very small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the Highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker and brewer for his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another of the same trade. The scattered families...must learn to perform themselves a great number of little pieces of work"
</blockquote>

 <p>
   Once everyone has chosen their job, some type of exchange system must be created to facilitate trade. After all, the nailer needs meat and the butcher needs nails; the farmer needs tools and the blacksmith needs bread; and so on. The concept of a common currency is thus the logical conclusion to this need, for the nailer's products may be very valuable to the blacksmith, but not vice versa. Currency overrides this inequality. (Keep in mind that currency &#8800; money. "Currency is a medium of exchange", i.e., U.S. dollar bills, while "money is a store of value".)
 </p>

 <p>
   Currency has not always been paper. Cattle, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2715.Salt">salt</a>, shells, tobacco, and even sugar have been used as currency. These progressed to metals, such as copper and gold, due to their being both easily divisible and combinable (you can't split an oxen and it still be useful), not diminishing in quality over time, and ability to retain value (gold has been valuable for as long as humans have been around). The problem arises with verifying the metal's authenticity. How does one know its legitimate, both in weight and quality? One could easily disguise the exterior of a worthless metal (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_coin">chocolate</a>) with gold and claim it's all gold. Gold's density is 19.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, so taking off even a small amount decreases its value significantly, requiring accurate scales to prevent fraud.
 </p>

 <p>
   What does "value" <i>really</i> mean? Smith gives two opposing, yet complementary, definitions:
 </p>

 <blockquote>
   "The word <i>value</i>...has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object ["value in use"], and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys ["value in exchange"]. ... The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use."
 </blockquote>

<p>
  with corresponding examples:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything ... A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it."
</blockquote>

<p>
  Smith considers labor to be the source of value:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "The value of any commodity...to the person who possesses it...is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities."
</blockquote>

<p>
  It's important to note that "quantity of labor" does not necessarily mean time spent on the task, for "there may be more labor in an hour's hard work than in two hours easy business". Implied in this statement is the <i>quality</i> of labor, another important factor in determining the value of a commodity. Money is then used as the estimator of value in exchanges, rather than a direct exchange between products of two individuals' labor.
</p>

<p>
  Two common terms in economics are <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/HighSchool/RealvsNominal.html">real and nominal</a>. The <i>nominal price</i> is based off the value of money, i.e., gold and silver, and fluctuates regularly. The <i>real price</i> is based off the constant value of labor, where the consistency in value is only viewed from the laborer's perspective; the baker may not value the blacksmith's tools as much, yet the blacksmith worked just as hard as always to produce them. (Hint from Smith: whenever renting to another, ask for payment in corn, not money—you'll get more value! You can also <a href="https://commodity.com/soft-agricultural/corn/">trade corn</a>.)
