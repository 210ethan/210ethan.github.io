The use of the verb "smuggling" should be noted here, as smuggling and trafficking are not synonymous. Smuggling is the illegal transportation of a cooperative person from location A to location B. Trafficking is the illegal transportation of an uncooperative person from location A to location B and generally involves sex and/or slavery, among other things. All of the people in this book were smuggled into the U.S. willingly and without coercion.<br/><br/>The book revolves around two things: The most famous of snakeheads, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Ping">Cheng Chui Ping</a> (image <a href="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590951662179605b11ad2fe2/1:1/w_290,h_290,c_limit/sister-ping.jpg">here</a>, more commonly known by her moniker Sister Ping and the incident of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Venture"><i>Golden Venture</i></a>.<br/><br/>Born in Fujian, China (where a majority of snakeheads are from), Sister Ping immigrated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan">New York City's Chinatown</a> to run a shop, while also smuggling as her side hustle with her husband. She charged over $30,000 USD for a single person to be smuggled. Being from Fujian in that time generally meant that you were poor, an agreement was made: pay a small down payment, then pay the remaining balance after you got into the U.S. The remaining balance was paid through underground labor, e.g. dishwashing. Sister Ping's reputation was impeccable. She got people in safely and with money-back guarantee. As time progressed, other snakeheads got into the game, hopeful of the riches that came with the business. Snakeheads worked together to board people onto a common ship, making a single run cheaper than it would have been individually. Some even feigned association with Sister Ping to make their business seem more credible to prospective customers.<br/><br/>The Golden Venture was a cargo ship that intentionally ran aground outside of New York City. Almost 300 illegal aliens were on board and jumped ship in their attempt to make it to the promised land that was the U.S. Those that did not drown (10) or were not caught (not sure the number here) were taken to various prisons throughout the U.S. to await sentencing. It was here that they applied for asylum. Here is where it gets tricky. Snakeheads had taught their customers how to essentially guarantee their asylum request was granted. Just say you were persecuted in China and/or that you feared for your life, and bam! you can stay. This is problematic for obvious reasons. How are these claims meant to be verified? Lawyers and law enforcement have a few methods to check the aliens' veracity: Repeat what they said back to them, but change a small detail (if they confirm your sentence, then it contradicts what they just said). Ask them about something they said a few days ago and see if the story changes. Cross-examine other witnesses or official accounts. Even then, the possibility remains that some are just excellent liars or just really stuck to their script (after all, they had many months to get their stories straight). This delegitimizes other immigrants' asylum requests. You're from North Korea? Let us vet you first, and if you're clean, welcome to America. You're from Saddam's Iraq and opposed the Ba'ath Party? Prove it and we'll welcome you to America.<br/><br/>As you can see, immigration is a significant topic in this book and thankfully presents both sides of the still-ongoing, probably never-ending issue that was reignited during Trump's presidential campaign and administration. There are two landmarks in New York that are directly related to immigration:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island">Ellis Island</a>, an island in New York Harbor that served as the first stop of new immigrants coming to America, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The Statue of Liberty is a beacon of hope for all, immigrants and citizens alike. It principally represents freedom—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to do what you like within reason—and is one of the main reasons the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/10-countries-that-take-the-most-immigrants">U.S. is the country that accepts the most immigrants year after year</a>. The poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus"><i>The New Colossus</i></a> is posted inside the Statue, and includes the lines "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." While this poem is not the law, it describes the attitude of the U.S. in the early 1900s. Many Americans are of the mind that <a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/resources-reports/reports/immigration.html">immigrants made this country what it is today</a>. So, should we adhere to our ancestor's mindsets? Or has the world changed enough that it should remain a part of history? Being the most prosperous nation in the world (see Credit Suisse's 2019 global wealth report <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2019-en.pdf">here</a> (note: it will attempt to download a PDF) , do we have an obligation to accept immigrants of other countries that are plagued by conflict, adverse living conditions, and persecution? Should we offer reprieve to those who knowingly break their country's laws, even if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">law</a> is unjust (in our opinion)?This day and review are neither the time nor place for this topic, but the book begs these questions.<br/><br/>The snakeheads' importation methods were diverse at the end, but the journey up to then was template-like. First, get the customers out of China. This was not too difficult (the place of leaving was generally Hong Kong or a corrupt SE Asian country, like Thailand), but the consequence of being caught by authorities was severe. After leaving China, the customers generally followed a path that looks like something out of Verne's <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days"><i>Around the World in 80 Days</i></a> (but including South America). For example, a one path was "Fuzhou—Hong Kong—Bangkok—Moscow—Havana—Managua—Tucson". Entry in to the U.S. was done by boat, car (Sister Ping once used a false bottom in a vehicle to transport customers over the U.S.-Mexican border undetected), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote_(person)">coyotes</a>, or even plane. How did they get onto the plane, you ask? Fake identification. While on the plane, these were promptly destroyed and followed by—you guessed it—an asylum request. Once in the U.S., it was a free-for-all. They diffused throughout the U.S. (with most going to NYC's Chinatown) and became a part of the underground economy, getting paid under the table by their employers. Official (the person, not the adjective) corruption was paramount to snakeheads, hence the inclusion of the South American countries (is a source really needed for this?), specifically Guatemala, in their path to freedom. <br/><br/>The legal perspective of snakeheads is examined in-depth: investigations into gangs and their relationship with snakeheads (gangs often acted as enforcers for the snakeheads, but eventually  began having some form of control over the snakeheads), the trial of Sister Ping, and so on. <br/><br/>Other topics discussed: Fujian culture, Chinese gangs and their terrorization of Chinatown (through acts like <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protection_money">protection money</a>), how the state of China at the time promoted the emigration of their own citizens.<br/><br/>Keefe did an excellent job with this book. The sources are well-documented, he is impartial (asking tough questions of one side of the aisle does not mean you lean to the other side!), and a holistic view of the issue is presented.<br/><br/>See also:<br/>	- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40163119-say-nothing"><i>Say Nothing</i></a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.

He cited countless examples of how people's lives have markedly improved during or after a traumatic event or major conflict, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz">The Blitz</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.<br/><br/>While applicable to a lot of veterans, it is not exclusively for them. Everyone can learn something from this book, whether it be to promote inclusiveness in your community, not treat veterans as victims, or just to be kind to one another.<br/><br/>The book itself is quite short. An average reader can probably finish it within 2 hours.<br/><br/>See also:<br/>	- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78127.On_Killing">On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society</a> by Lt.

Drugs, alcohol, coffee, pornography, nothing. I haven't had the gross misfortune of being prescribed and becoming reliant on pain medication, only to have the rug pulled out from under my feeble feet, forcing me to search for alternative opiate sources, like heroin or oxycodone. I have never had to plan my day around an addiction, wondering how I'll last until lunch or closing unless I get my fix. I've never had to steal from friends or family in an effort to scrounge up enough for a 15 minutes of pleasure and reprieve from withdrawals. I do not claim to know what addiction is like, but reading from other sources (mainly the internet and friends), I have a minute fraction of an idea of how it develops and transforms a person.<br/><br/><i>Requiem for a Dream</i> is a book about addiction and what it does to people's lives. Four individuals are followed over the course of an indeterminate time period: Harry, a drug-dealing heroin addict; Tyrone, Harry's partner and fellow addict; Marion, Harry's girlfriend and fellow addict; and Sara, Harry's mother and television and diet pill addict.<br/><br/>Their lives start out addiction-free. Harry and Tyrone are semi-regular heroin users. Harry occasionally pawns  his mother's television to get enough money to score, and they both work odd jobs when needed. Marion doesn't do much work-wise. Sara eats quite a bit (bagels with cream cheese and danishes are her favorite) while watching television all day.<br/><br/>Harry and Tyrone eventually come up with the bright idea of selling heroin, referred to as "dope" in the novel. (FYI: <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dope">dope = heroin</a> in the drug world. Dope =/= marijuana, cocaine, or anything else.) Their plan was simple: sell enough (but don't get high!!) to get rich enough to do whatever they wanted. Business starts booming for them, and Harry is able to afford a new TV for his mother and new clothes for himself and everything is going accordingly to plan and Marion and Harry have these amazing plans to build an open-air coffee house where artists can drink coffee from a hundred different countries while mingling and connecting with other artists. (That's a snippet of how the book is written. Many run-on sentences, some spanning over one page.) But this honeymoon phase only lasts so long. Harry and Marion start to up their dope usage. A hit here and there, but not much more than their normal amount.  The coffee house plans sit untouched while they continue to plan their lives together: what kind of family they'll have, the car and house they'll own, how they'll live. But they can easily stop anytime they want - this stuff doesn't have that much of a grip on them.<br/><br/>Then the great shortage happens. There's no dope to be found in the city. Whispers on the street hint of a new supply coming tomorrow, the next day, next week, but the number of times those rumors are actually realized is small. This is the first time the reader realizes that Harry and Marion are addicted to dope. Selby's ability to transition the couple from average users to their current state is subtle and masterful. They start to realize their uncomfortableness when they won't or don't have a hit for the morning. Irritability and anxiety and dread soon follow. Now, I know what you're thinking, they're addicted. Well, that's where you're wrong. They can still stop anytime, but times are hard and this takes the edge off, so why stop now? (You can see the pattern of rationalizing that has been taking place.)<br/><br/>Eventually, a reputable source is able to get heroin into the city. Every junkie from miles around converges on a single part of the city, Harry and Tyrone among them. They cop (buy), book it back to their place, get off, then cut and bag the rest (short, of course) for selling. Marion questions his supply: Do you really have to sell that much?  What if there is no more? What about us? How will we get our fix?<br/><br/>Marion turns to selling herself to a heroin supplier. She does what she needs to with him without hesitation to score a few bags (without Harry knowing that she is hiding two of them), eventually getting with other women at the supplier's request to get her oh-so-precious fix. It was gross, but easy enough when considering what was on the line. Did she really want to be dopesick for hours on end, or just be uncomfortable for a half-hour?<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, Sara is busy getting addicted to diet pills, prescribed to her by her doctor. These are amphetamines. For those that have ever taken Adderall, Vyvanse, methanphetamine, etc. you realize you don't think about eating nor get hungry. She really, really wants to fit into her beautiful red dress for when she eventually makes it onto television (she's going on, there's no way she isn't, they called her and everything and they still have her card and she's just waiting for the call to tell her what show she'll be on and she'll be ready, more ready than any of the other contestants, because she's been watching every single quiz show on the tube and practicing her walk-up and smile and wave and it's perfect, but she just needs the call!!!!!!!!). The pills do their job—she's lost over 25 pounds—but at a cost. She hasn't had a proper meal in months, and they are no longer having the same effect. She goes back to the doctor's office and gets prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam">Valium</a> to calm her down. This mix of uppers and downers is potent, sending her to hospital where she is deemed schizophrenic and is treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a> at the recommendation of an impulsive doctor. She tries protesting, telling them she can't breath or eat and it hurts, but to no avail. She lives out the rest of her days in the mental hospital with no television to watch or cheese danishes to eat.<br/><br/>The book ends with Harry and Tyrone driving straight to the source in Miami. Harry's arm becomes infected while in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South">Deep South</a>  and they both get arrested for being New York dopers in their town. Harry gets his arm amputated and Tyrone is sentenced to a few months on a work crew, where he is repeatedly harassed for being black.<br/><br/>As I said, I've never been addicted to anything, nor do I plan on it (does anyone ever?). But I can say that addiction is hell for everyone. Short periods of temporary relief followed by longer periods of looking forward to the next fix leave the user in a perpetual hell, being cooled off every so often by ice water, yet still surrounded by scorching-hot flames. The pleasure of some of these drugs is a million times better than the best orgasm you've ever had, and you know how great that feels. Your brain chemistry will physically change and your body and mind and life will become dependent on the drug, subsequently changing your personality and behaviors and thoughts and the entire person you once were. You become a shell of your former self and lose family and friends to the only two-faced friend left in your life: the drug. Everything that used to give you pleasure—video games, food, theme parks—pales in comparison to this drug. Nothing will ever compare to this, and anything you do thereafter will never give you the same level of satisfaction as before.<br/><br/>If you want to hear from (presumably) real opiate users on their experiences, I encourage you to browse the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/">r/opiates subreddit</a>. Users (no pun intended) discuss their use and addiction, as applicable. You can see how addiction develops, try to understand what withdrawal symptoms feel like and why they will do almost anything to avoid them, and get a general sense of what usage is like. Another glimpse into how quickly it gets real is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/68srty/spontaneoush_uses_heroin_gets_addicted_dies_gets/">u/SpontaneousH's experience with heroin</a>. He spontaneously (hence the username) tried heroin and promptly got addicted, as seen in his post history <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpontaneousH/posts/">here</a>. His original r/IAmA has telltale signs of what ends up happening. Thankfully, his last update told us he is 6 years clean.<br/><br/>See also:<br/>	- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru-LgSvOCrE">Otherside by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis</a>.

Drug-related, but not necessarily directly addiction-related (because hey, it's impossible for marijuana to be addictive /s).<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Arabian Sands</td><td>Wilfred Thesiger</td><td>3</td><td>Sometimes I wish I was born a few generations earlier. No, I am not a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/le-wrong-generation">le wrong generation kid</a> complaining about <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/2018-soundcloud-rappers-guide.html">Soundcloud rappers</a>. I'm complaining about the lack of uncharted territory in the world. Reading Thesiger's account of his exploration of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali">Empty Quarter</a>. He is truly venturing into the unknown, without knowledge of what lies in that vast, arid, uninhabitable (the Bedu would beg to differ) region. There are <a href="https://www.insider.com/unexplored-places-around-the-world-2019-12#surtsey-a-volcanic-island-off-of-iceland-has-only-ever-been-open-to-researchers-3">very few places</a> left on Earth that are unexplored, namely islands and other hard-to-access places. I can only imagine the wonder and excitement Thesiger felt as he traveled in places no human had before.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this book was published in 1959, before the globalization and modernization of Arabia and the essential extinction of traditional Bedu culture.<br/><br/>The book switches off between two topics: Thesiger's travel accounts and discussion of Arab, specifically Bedu, culture. The travel accounts are quite detailed, sometimes to the point of boring, but do an excellent job of describing the Sands and their brutality, monotony, and beauty. Rain is scarce, but an ample rainfall provides up to years of grazing for the Bedu's beloved camels (more on this later). The dunes stretch <a href="https://www.wildfrontierstravel.com/media/cache/responsive/hero-1920/upload/6f/11/6f1135106019f2b03374ae86a0a8c8d0b5383964.jpeg?413f26a0">on and on and on and on for miles</a> and <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BMikbnHP7oQeYVE4ZKc9B716MtCTSZLzroQ9hTnGnCKO8ziCDuij6EIr-wV6WCF0LEUN1aUg7vPuOHSDhxEzkjz57cbyy8Fi--9dp92NO4oYtqd6KsQ">rise up hundreds of feet</a>, preventing even the most durable of camels from summiting. And yet Thesiger could not keep away. He found himself pining for the Sands whenever at home in England and did whatever he could to get back to his second home of Arabia. <br/><br/>Back to camels: surprisingly, unless you are already knowledegable about the Bedu, they comprise a significant portion of the book. They are the Bedu's racehorse-equivalent, although the camels aren't <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/kentucky-derby-names-best">named like horses</a>. Camels are treated with the utmost respect by their owners due to their career as a desert workhorse. Food, water, and rest are prioritized for the camels. Bedu are also similar to elephants in that they <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephants-never-forget/">never forget</a> (any camel they see). If they see a camel, it is forever burned into their memory. They also have the rather remarkable skill of being able to analyze a situation based off of a <a href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/ERM2R0/camel-tracks-in-the-red-sahara-sand-in-northern-sudan-150000-camels-ERM2R0.jpg">camel's tracks in the dry desert sand</a>. This claim, which sounds like nonsense, is corroborated on <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-zls4_rVzQgC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=bedu+camel+tracks&source=bl&ots=iqhKm_T2tr&sig=ACfU3U0-E201d86MXwxtoWX9bocXO0yhDQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwia-oCR6KfoAhUGeKwKHfdiC_kQ6AEwAXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=bedu%20camel%20tracks&f=false">page 59</a> of this 234-page book on camels, appropriately named <i>Camel</i> and <a href="https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200402/reading.the.sands.htm">this article</a> (Control-F the word "read" for the specific instances).<br/><br/>Bedu personality is very peculiar. They will bicker with each other about money, even after the transaction is months old. They will absolutely not let a guest refuse a meal - if you're with them, you're eating, no questions asked. To look greedy is to be known as the guy that eats the last piece of [your friend group's favorite food here], but ten times worse. If you accidentally kill a Bedu, say by accidentally kicking him in his solar plexus (like Thesiger did), you will die. No joke. The list goes on. Thesiger learned all of these intricacies throughout his years of living amongst the Bedu.<br/><br/>One passage spoke to me directly: "No, it is not the goal but the way there that matters, and the harder the way the more worth while the journey… I felt instinctively that it was better to fail on Everest withut oxygen than to attain the summit with its use." it seems like most modern-day adventurers use (read: require) varying amounts of assistance, whether it be through tools or personnel. For example, only 5% of Everest summits have been without oxygen. That is not to take away from those who did it with the precious gas, but it is significantly less impressive than their counterparts. Why can't things go back to being raw? If you can't bench press that weight without elbow sleeves, a bench shirt, a Gateway-Arch-esque spine, and your hands touching the plate, you shouldn't be benching that weight, just like you shouldn't be climbing Everest if you need a porter, five oxygen tanks, and all the latest and greatest REI gear (I also wrote about this in my review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3102763674"><i>Into Thin Air</i></a> (last paragraph before "Further Reading"). Mark Twight also embodies this. During his days at Gym Jones, they trained balls-to-the-wall in street clothes without worrying that their shirt wasn't of moisture-wicking technology. Anyway, rant over. Do what you want and what makes you happy.<br/><br/>An insert is included, containing pictures of bin Kabina, one of Thesiger's longest travel mates and to whom the book is dedicated, other Bedu (such as falconers), and landscape shots. Names of Bedu that Thesiger travels with can be difficult to keep track of, so "A List of the Chief Characters on the Various Journeys" is included as an appendix, organized by specific trip, e.g. "The Journey from Salala to Mughshin."<br/><br/>That's about it. If you want to learn more about Bedu culture and read a classic in the travel literature genre, then this is the book for you. If you're interested in how early maps were mapped, then this is a book for you. If you're wanting to go on an adventure in a barren wasteland with the occasional oasis and need an estimate on how much it will suck, this is a book for you._x000B_<br/>My three stars is the average of my enjoyment (2) and thoroughness of the book (4).<br/><br/>Further materials:<br/>	- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDWNFueckoM"> The Empty Quarter documentary (1967)</a>.<br/>	- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5934152-the-silent-world">The Silent World</a>.

After a while with the NZSAS, both Coburn and his friend Pete venture to Hereford to attempt to join the 22 SAS. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Special_Forces_Selection#Aptitude_Phase_(hill_phase)_(4_weeks)">22 SAS selection</a> includes the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Dance_(exercise)">Fan Dance</a>.

The quest for a unified Ireland began by the southerners being peaceful, only to come to the conclusion that, despite the popular saying, violence <i>was</i> the answer.<br/><br/><i>Say Nothing</i> uses the lives of two individuals to provide a history and story of the Troubles: Dolours Price, an IRA Volunteer ("Volunteer" is their proper name, but is akin to soldier), and Jean McConville, a mother-of-ten who was kidnapped and murdered by the IRA after being accused of being an informant to the British.<br/><br/>The book follows the Troubles in chronological order, beginning in the early 1960s (there is no definitive start date of the conflict) up to the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, which was deemed "Got Fuck All" by some.<br/><br/>Many major players in the Troubles were discussed and interviewed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams">Gerry Adams</a>, an IRA-member-turned-denier and eventual president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> political party, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Hughes">Brendan Hughes</a>, an IRA Volunteer who led their "special operations" (for lack of a better term) and organized the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Friday_(1972)">Bloody Friday</a> (which he publicly and deeply regrets), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_McIntyre">Mackers</a>, another IRA Volunteer who ended up leading the interview process of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797">Belfast Project</a>, an oral history of the Troubles told by former IRA Volunteers who now disagreed with what the movement had become.<br/> <br/>The perspectives of all are given throughout. Readers will better understand why the Troubles started in the first place, why the IRA did what they did, and why the conflict was so prolonged. <br/><br/>Despite the thoroughness of the book, Keefe did omit some aspects, e.g. loyalist terrorism. He humbly acknowledges this and directs the interested reader to "one of the many excellent books cited in the notes that address the Troubles more broadly or your favored subject in particular." Sources and notes are discussed in full and included at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that does a good job of portraying the perspectives of the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles.

With hundreds of people collaborating on a single, multi-faceted project, an astronomical amount of progress is able to be achieved. And yet, often this is done for free, without expectation of riches or fame to follow. The question that follows is obvious: Why? Why would people spend time <u>outside</u> of their paid job to code for little to no recognition nor money? Well, why do people volunteer in general? For one, they feel part of a community helping to volunteer. The same feeling applies for these OS projects. These contributors are working with people from all over the world with similar interests, helping them to improve a project for everyone else. A sense of progress is another motivator. We as humans love to see tangible progress in things we do. Productivity apps nowadays rely on the concept of "gamifying" things, i.e. showing you making progress while doing various tasks. Every accepted pull request on Github is one small (or possibly big) step of progress for that project and anything that project goes to support.<br/><br/>Anyways, off my soapbox and onto the book.<br/><br/>The book primarily focuses on the inception, development, and commercialization of the open-source operating system <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>. Originally created in 1991 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, a Finnish graduate student at the time, as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">MINIX</a>, it grew exponentially as more and more people online heard about it.<br/><br/> Other relevant open-source projects, concepts, and people are detailed and discussed, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project">GNU Project</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a>. (GPL is quite clever in that any product that uses another product that is licensed under GPL must also be licensed under GPL. The product's freeness then propagates the down the line. This concept is called copyleft.)<br/><br/>Note that this book was published in 2001, well before the advent of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, a company that hosts both public and private projects. It used a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, which was also created by Linus to help aide Linux development. While I don't keep up with software news, I suspect this book can easily be rewritten to reflect the events that have occurred in the open-source community since 2001 (20 years ago, what!).<br/><br/>If you are interested in programming as a career or hobby, I highly encourage you to join Github and see if you can help contribute to an open-source project. They are always looking for people to help, even if your experience is little to none. Find a project, fix a bug or add a feature, and submit a pull request. The worst thing that can happen is it gets rejected.<br/><br/>My rating is two stars for excitement (no offense, but how exciting can a book like this be?) and five stars for comprehensiveness and research put into this book. There is no source section, but he mentions "the vast majority of quotations in this book are drawn from interviews".

Now, what if this new continent covered the remaining 71% of the Earth?<br/><br/>This is the feeling of wonder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau">Jacques Cousteau</a> felt when he finally succeeded in breathing while underwater with his invention the <a href="https://us.aqualung.com/pages/our-story">Aqualung</a> (Emile Gagnan contributed heavily to the engineering aspect of it). After many failed attempts at other devices, the Aqualung was able to let Cousteau and his fellow divers breath easily and safely underwater, marking the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving">SCUBA</a> revolution.<br/><br/>The book begins with a history of underwater breathing attempts and devices, giving the reasons behind why they didn't work and what was done to improve the designs.<br/><br/>From there, Cousteau goes into details about the underwater adventures he and his group (he directed the French military's Undersea Research Group) had over the years, sound almost Captain-Nemo-like: cave diving to the point of almost passing out, exceeding the estimated underwater depth limits of humans, exploring shipwrecks and finding "treasure" (if you can count old silverware), testing the closest distance TNT can explode and the diver still survive (yes, you read that right), and the various creatures and flora encountered while diving.<br/><br/>The science of diving (what the bends (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness">decompression sickness</a>) is and how it occurs, the total number of atmospheres felt at various depths, etc) is explained throughout and in detail. <br/><br/>The insert is 65 pages (pictures of both in black-and-white and color) of underwater action shots, group and individual portraits, and other supporting images to put a picture with/to the text. Included is Cousteau's closest encounter with a shark, where it came within two feet of him.<br/><br/>My only qualm with this book, as at least one other reviewer pointed out, is their killing of underwater life. While URG occasionally showed some discretion, contests were made out to kill X lbs of fish in Y minutes, it seems all for fun. Later, while watching traditional Mediterranean fishing from below (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5KWbc_iXCQ">video here</a>, note it may be a bit offensive to some), Cousteau expresses his desire to free the fish from their ever-tightening graveyard.<br/><br/>After reading this, I plan to do some SCUBA diving at some point, preferably in the Caribbean or Mediterranean.</td></tr><tr><td>RAZE Anthology: A Fistfight with Human Nature</td><td>Mark Twight</td><td>4</td><td>While a lot of topics are discussed in this book, I have a few all-encompassing takeaways (in order of importance): never stop growing, and assume control of what is yours (life) and what you want (from life), and take risks.<br/><br/>Life is a growing process, both literally and figuratively. Everyone reaches peak bone mass in their late 20s, but some continue to grow muscles or fat after that, cutting and bulking or maintaining that state for years on end. This growth is second to the growth of the mind. The word "learning" can easily replace the word "growing" in this paragraph's first sentence: Life is a learning process. We as both individuals and a species are constantly inventing, discovering, and refining what we do and how we do it — sometimes for ourselves and sometimes for others. Failure is a major part of growth. Failure gives feedback on actions and thoughts, allowing learning to occur. Was that the best way to go about this? Why did I think that would work? This feedback need not be applied solely to that specific action or thought, but can instead be used across a range of them: what worked in realm A can easily be applied in realm B, etc. Mark says "Truth is the source of growth," and this is spot-on. Taking an honest look at ourselves or situations gives us a clear view of what needs to be done. I'm guilty of lying to myself on many occasions to avoid the reality of the situation — this only served to make things worse later on. Do yourself a favor and be brutally honest to yourself and a-bit-less-than-brutally-honest to your companions (brutal honesty can be a bit much for some, which can cause them to use Mark's "knife" on you!) from the get-go. Those companions that appreciate the honesty are definitely worth keeping.<br/><br/><a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight"><i>Twitching with Twight</i></a>, arguably Mark's most famous essay (it's included in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill"><i>Kiss or Kill</i></a>), is a prime example of seizing control of life, cutting off the excess fat and distractions, and focusing on the goals and desires one truly wants. A key part of this is the "cutting" - often times certain objects (gear), people (significant others or friends), or mindsets (fear of failure, lack of belief of capability) hold us back from achieving our true potential. Cliche, yes, but true nonetheless. Mark discusses the "knife", referring to his ability to "cut off everything that might have held [him] back." While some view this cutting as detrimental, it can actually be quite beneficial. Take the friend who is a leech on your wellbeing or the mindset that you will never be able to climb that route or lift that much weight. Cut that friend out of your life and believe in your ability to achieve that feat - these cuts will greatly improve your life, assuming you do your part of putting in the work to achieve these goals. Mark says it best at the end of "Unlock" piece: "It [control] can start anywhere — we need only realize that the lock is within, and the key within reach. ... We learn that by taking control of ourselves we reduce the power others have over us. ... the goal of [fitness] is autonomy. It is Self-determination." (While I'm sure those that read this book are aware of Mark's background, he created the reputed <a href="https://gymjones.com/">Gym Jones</a>, hence the fitness references found throughout the book.) Unsurprisingly, Mark is a fan of Ayn Rand, referencing her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead?from_search=true&qid=ysdj3ExhFT&rank=1"><i>The Fountainhead</i></a> and acknowledging her influence in his own <i>Kiss or Kill</i>.<br/><br/>Part of this "taking control" is standing strong against the norm — one must find their own way among the vast sea of disinformation and what is considered "right" and "good". (Howard Roark, <i>The Fountainhead</i>'s protagonist, is a great example of this.) In high school, I kept my interests hidden from my friends, as it was different from what others thought a normal teenager should be doing. In hindsight, this was *somewhat* wrong. While being proud of some interested would have gotten me made fun of, others likely would not have. I now unashamedly promote most of my interests, only hiding the ones that deviate significantly from the norm. "We need more individuals, of unique opinion and voice and strength."<br/><br/>Taking and accepting risks is an important part of the human experience. They can be frightening, exhilarating, and/or wildly rewarding, depending on the venture. It is especially rewarding when that risk pays off and you grow as a person. Not much more needs to be said on this. Analyze the possible outcomes and those outcomes' outcomes and all of their respective probabilities, then make the choice to push ahead and stay back. Just make sure you won't regret it later.<br/><br/>Now, a bit about the book itself. The book is simply a series of short (1-3 page) essays. The writing can be a bit cryptic at times, as you'll know if you've read <i>Kiss or Kill</i>. This turned me off at times, but is helpful in provoking thought about what Twight meant and why he expressed it that way. It is full of images that have accompanying text: some photographs (portraits, action shots, nature-related), some renderings (not sure if that's the right word, but it's the best I have), some paintings (?).

(Objective meaning the value of stolen goods is accurate. Stolen artwork's value is difficult to quantify.) While the heist itself comprises most of the book, the authors discuss culture and industry information as needed.<br/><br/>The book is organized in rough chronological order. It begins with a detailed history of the Italian city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin">Turin</a>, where all of the thieves involved in the heist hail from. The chapter is titled <i>School of Turin</i>, referencing the not-insignificant amount of career criminals that the city produces (schools may be a better verb here). The authors describe the history and culture of the city, and how Notarbartolo, the mastermind behind the heist, fits in to the city.<br/><br/>The history and current standing of the diamond industry is provided throughout the book: culture, conflict (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond">blood diamonds</a>), and standard operating procedures, among other aspects. Readers will also learn how the giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Legal_issues">De Beers unashamedly has (had?) a monopoly</a> on the diamond industry. (Consider getting your significant other a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/3e8w8q/moissanite_vs_diamond/">moissanite stone</a> or lab-grown diamond. Significantly less expensive and conflict-free!)<br/><br/>A majority of the book details the planning, preparation, and execution of the heist. Notarbartolo spent over two years casing the building and its security before they executed. These two years were not spent waiting for the right moment - Notarbartolo was constantly taking notes and gaining information crucial to the heist (type of vault door, patterns of security, etc). He made regular trips back to Italy to consult with his partners and share his recent learnings.<br/><br/>These two long years culminated on the evening of 15 February 2003. The team was able to infiltrate the building using a homemade garage door opener (with 2^8 = 1024 possible frequencies, it is easy to iterate through the combinations to find the correct one to open the door). They proceeded to the vault, where they were able to bypass/disable three alarms/sensors: motion, sound, and a magnet inside the vault door. Once inside, the rest was easy. Using a specialized tool, the thieves were easily able to pry open a majority of the rather flimsy safety deposit boxes belonging to a variety of companies and individuals. The loot was varied: gemstones, watches, currency, securities/bonds, and personal effects. There was so much to steal that they had to leave a fair amount behind. Using a getaway car, they retreated to Notarbartolo's apartment to sift through their treasure, throwing out comparatively-worthless emeralds.<br/><br/>The following morning, each member left separately (some in groups of two) to head back to Italy while the crime was being discovered only a small distance away. One member was tasked with disposing of the trash, which included some compromising materials. He chose what turned out to be one of the unluckiest spots in all of Belgium: a forest owned by a nothing-better-to-do-than-patrol-his-land-for-litterers man. (Not to say littering is acceptable, but dumping garbage in forests is common in Belgium and not many seem to care (according to the authors).) This was the downfall of the team. The detectives were immediately dispatched to the rural plot of land and were able to begin piecing together who was behind this expensive crime. <br/><br/>After dividing their haul accordingly in the safety of Italy, Notarbartolo returned to Antwerp to tie up loose ends, unaware that he was the most-wanted man in the country. He was promptly detained along with his wife and friends, marking the beginning of his multi-year confinement (consisting of detainment and actual imprisonment). The authors briefly describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Belgium">Belgian legal system</a> and prisons in this section.<br/><br/>While in prison, Notarbartolo attempted to sell the rights to <i>his</i> story (emphasis discussed in next sentence) to multiple sources. "His" is highlighted because it varies wildly from both what the authors write here and what is probable/believable. The authors refute his account in the last section.<br/><br/>The authors preface the book by describing their research method. Throughout the book, they are careful to denote hazy, non-established points, e.g. no one knows why the thieves did this, but here's why we think they did it, etc. Notes are detailed and well-documented for further reading or referencing.<br/><br/>I see a few things wrong with the team's operation. First is the poor disposal of the garbage. To put everything together is sheer idiocy. Throwing it away in an unknown location doubles up on the foolishness. Too much of their heist was left up to blind luck (that was decreased to an extent): avoiding building guards or police, not knowing about a hidden sensor, and so on. They had over two years to prepare for the simple garbage disposal, yet failed in the worst possible way. Second is Notarbartolo's failure to place goods in his safety deposit box then proceed to rob himself (his box wasn't even opened!). He claimed that he took everything out beforehand, but even then that is suspicious. Instead, he should have placed a significant amount of material in there and simply pried open his, too. Third is their lack of Italian extradition laws. While these eventually changed under pressure from other European nations, resulting in the imprisonment of other members of the team, they would have all been safe for quite a long time had they just stayed in Italy. I suspect it would have also been more difficult to gather a case against them. Fourth, they should not have taken specifically-dated surveillance tapes, but rather all of them. This shifts focus off of those specific days and obscures the suspect list. Their disposal of the tapes was also subpar: they simply pulled them apart. Investigators were able to reconstruct them, furthering the evidence they had against the team. Surprisingly fundamental mistakes by a team intelligent enough to plan and execute a heist of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book.

However, being published in 1997, there had only been a few multi-death events.)<br/><br/>The book provides a list of people and their affiliations, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of who's who, and a map of the route taken from Everest base camp to the summit.<br/><br/>Krakauer provides a history of Everest throughout the book, from the initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary">Hillary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay">Tenzing</a> ascent to modern-day climbs, as well as the progression of the climbing itself and culture behind it. People often think climbing Everest is a simple task: go to Nepal/Tibet (there's a Tibet route), acclimate to the altitude, rent some O2 tanks, then get yourself up to the top. In reality, it is an extremely expensive ($11,000 permit just to be allowed to climb from the Nepal side) and time-consuming (two months is about average summit time) adventure. Teams will hire base camp managers just to coordinate resources for getting up the mountain. Included in this history is Krakauer's expeditions's lead guide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Hall">Rob Hall</a>'s climbing experience.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people">Sherpa</a> culture is described more in-depth than expected. Their superstitions, competitiveness for climbing bids, and traditions are explained in the context of climbing Everest.<br/><br/>Climbing terms and concepts are explained as needed for those that are unfamiliar.<br/><br/>The summit trip began on May 6 and is described extremely in-depth. Krakauer provides everyone's movements and survivor's experiences. Krakauer is one of the first to get back to Camp Four safely, unaware of the other climbers experiencing the storm higher up on the mountain.<br/><br/>Krakauer reflects on the decisions both he and others made while up on the mountain. However, the brain behaves significantly differently when hypoxic (almost impossible to avoid at Everest-level altitudes) and under extreme fatigue (both from lack of sleep and physical exertion).<br/><br/>The last 50-ish pages account the evacuation of the injured off the mountain and Krakauer's personal dealings with what happened.<br/><br/>A postscript is provided to refute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Boukreev">Anatoli Boukreev</a>'s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/925367.The_Climb?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=7KSpx3LmL3&rank=1"><i>The Climb</i></a> and the criticisms of <i>Into Thin Air</i>. Boukreev was a lead guide for another expedition who descended from the summit long before many of his expedition's clients made it up. A quote from the book describing Boukreev's guide philosophy: "... strongly held opinions about how the mountain should be ascended. He was quite outspoken in his belief that it was a mistake for guides to pamper their clients. 'If client cannot climb Everest without big help from guide, this client should not be on Everest. Otherwise there can be big problems up high.'" <br/><br/> Further reading:<br/>- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=I3m3dPahoA&rank=4"><i>Kiss or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Mountain Climber</i></a> by Mark Twight</td></tr><tr><td>The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Confession</td><td>Leo Tolstoy</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success</td><td>Lisa Endlich</td><td>3</td><td>I am often in a pickle with some of the non-fiction books I read. The research that goes into some of them is easily five-star-quality, but the topic is so dull (to me!) that my enjoyment is a mere one- or two-star. Using this type of two-quality rating system, <i>Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success</i> deserves a solid three stars: five for research, thoroughness, and analysis, and one for my personal satisfaction.<br/><br/>Lisa Endlich, a former GS VP and trader, lays out the complete history of Goldman Sachs during its privately-owned days (inception up to May 1999, when the company went public). Chapters are separated by years, some short (Chapter 4 is 1990-1991) and some long (Chapter 2 is 1869-1976).<br/><br/>In discussing the history, the expansion into foreign/emerging markets and new geographical places is focused on. There was often debate between GS becoming a jack of all trades and master of none, or focusing on a select few business divisions and becoming the best in those. In the end, they essentially decided both. Without expanding into new businesses, the firm would not be able to expand as they wanted to.<br/><br/>Partnership is one of the common themes you will see throughout the book. To become a partner means you've made it, plain and simple. It is an exclusive, prestigious club that only a select few get the privilege of becoming a part of. Partners were inducted every X years (I forgot exactly, may be X = 1) after a lengthy, intense, and argumentative session about who should be chosen and who should be left behind. Some left the firm after being told this wasn't their year, feeling betrayed after giving their working life to the firm.<br/><br/>The subtitle, <i>The Culture of Success</i>, is also a common theme. At GS, you must be a contributor (why is this not a policy everywhere?), else you will see the door very quickly. GS attempted to recruit the smartest, hardest-working people, especially those who would put the firm at the top of their priorities. Through this selection process, the firm's culture of success and competitiveness was created.<br/><br/>While I'm sure the media contributes to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/11/goldman-sachs-doj-settlement/>modern-day image of GS</a> (sorry for paywall, but the headline is enough to make the point</a> and bankers in general, none of its misdeeds are discussed in the book, not that it was expected. A few quotes (I can't find them in the book, so take my word) struck me as funny after a GS event (see below) a few years ago: they stress the idea that customers are first and foremost in ensuring the successfulness of GS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS9r1Dk-Zg8&feature=youtu.be&t=45">GS took a position against the product they were selling to customers</a>, yet Blankfein continues to defend his firm's actions... How!<br/><br/>The later chapters are devoted to the discussion of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/other-information/ipo-prospectus-gs-pdf-file.pdf">GS's famous IPO</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Corzine">Jon Corzine</a>, former trader and then-CEO, was instrumental in convincing the partnership of selling the company to the public. This decision was made over the course of many, many years, roundtables, and hours of analysis and thinking. The IPO did not come fast enough from their final "yes", though. The market soon tumbled, and what was going to make some of the top partners $100MM+ richer soon went down into a measly (ha!) 8-figure range.<br/><br/>Some amount of financial literacy and understanding of how markets operate would help, but is not necessary.<br/><br/>For similar books, see <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254826/index.htm">Fortune's <i>The Smartest [Business] Books We Know</i></a>.

Food is allowed to be purchased, guards take bribes willingly (not sure about this one in the U.S.), and if you escape and make it out of Turkey, they will likely not pursue you, with the unspoken agreement that you will never step foot onto Turkish soil again. In the case of the prison Hayes spent most of his time in, children were in an adjacent facility, allowing them to play ball together during recesses.<br/><br/>Smuggling was commonplace throughout the prisons. Hashish (wait, what?), drugs, and other items were smuggled in by various means, such as outside workers, and sold to inmates. Billy received money hidden in books sent to him.<br/><br/>The frustration of the bureaucratic process of Hayes' case is embedded in the text. He constantly writes to a U.S. official at the embassy for assistance, but doesn't hear back for weeks at a time, only to find out the case has moved nowhere. Turkish lawyers give Hayes hope of early release after charging him hundreds or thousand of lira, then claim they haven't been able to make progress or what they said earlier didn't hold. On the bright side, Hayes' sentence was commuted several times: originally sentenced to four years, the charge was changed to smuggling from possession resulting in a standard length of life. After being bumped down to 30 years, he was granted amnesty and the sentence again commuted. Finally, good behavior knocks off a third of your final sentence length. This left Hayes with a grand total of about seven years in prison.<br/><br/>After trying multiple avenues of both legal and illegal escape (using U.S. clout, getting transferred to an insane asylum, attempting to use a file to cut the bars on his window), he settled on escaping from an island prison. Hayes swam out to anchored fishing boats, stole a small dingy, then rowed to shore, where he poorly disguised himself and was able to make his way to Greece. He was captured by Greek forces, interrogated (nicely) for a few weeks, then finally deported back to the U.S.<br/><br/>Hayes also discusses his emotional state throughout his imprisonment in regards to his parents (specifically his father), his lover (Lillian), and friendships (and sexual relations) with fellow inmates. "The emotional coldness of prison life was worth than the physical cold. Loneliness is an aching pain." Massive guilt is felt about his crime and how it has affected his parents, especially after his father's warnings about dropping out of university and going to travel the world would get him into "trouble". His father was significantly impacted financially due to lawyer fees and travel costs (later helped by the book's advance money). His lover, Lillian, was extremely supportive during his imprisonment and played a significant role in making it easier on him. Some friendships were formed, one of which turned into a sexual one through a basic need for human touch and love.<br/><br/>I think Hayes did a good job of describing both what prison life is like on the body, mind, and soul. My one takeaway (that was already well ingrained in me): don't go to prison!<br/><br/>Some further videos to watch: Wes Watson, a former <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shot%20caller">shot caller</a> in a California state prison gang, discusses his experiences in prison and why you never, ever want to go there. While the stories can't be completely corroborated, they are not unreasonable to believe. This should further viewers' desires not to end up in prison one day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUxLYGeeIKxxioUqL54Q8g">Channel here</a>.

There is also sufficient coverage of his life before the ambassadorship and after his forced resignation.<br/><br/>Dodd, a professor of American history at University of Chicago focusing on the American South, was recommended to Roosevelt by an old friend. Having completed his PhD studies at Leipzig University in German, he was already familiar with the culture and language and could hit the ground running when he arrived. He hesitantly accepted and brought his family: wife, Mattie, daughter, Martha, and son, Bill Jr.<br/><br/>The book focuses mostly on Dodd, but a good portion is also spent on Martha and her various love affairs and doings in Berlin. Martha starts out as a Nazi sympathizer, claiming they are simply proud of their country and wanting the best for it after the disastrous WWI. She is courted by multiple Nazis, including Gestapo chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diels">Rudolf Diels</a>, and a Russian secretly working for the NKVD (Russian secret police). Her support for the Nazi party gradually wanes as she experiences more violence and discontent among German citizens.<br/><br/>Multiple people (called the Pretty Good Club (this is the only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pretty-good-club-founding-fathers/dp/0393056589">book</a> I can find on them)) in the State Department were not fans of Dodd due to his lack of prestigious upbringing (read: lack of Ivy League education) and wealth. Due to the Great Depression happening in the U.S., Dodd insisted that he should live within his modest $17500 salary. This included driving his rather outdated Chevrolet or even walking to work. These seemingly innocent actions infuriated PGC, as it insulted and tainted the prestige of the ambassador position. I must agree with Dodd's position here, even if it is a bit extreme. He cites other U.S. officials and their relatively small families living in massive homes with opulent decor and numerous servants, all of which is unnecessary (a subjective word, but likely to be generally agreed upon). Passive aggressive letters were sent by the PGC in response to Dodd's, and other letters Dodd sent that were explicitly said to be confidential were leaked to the press to stir disfavor.<br/><br/>The naivety of Dodd and other U.S. officials surprised me. While hindsight is 20/20, the gross transgressions against U.S. citizens in Germany and the gradual restriction of Jewish rights/privileges should have been dealt with more severely. Several times the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">SA</a> attacked U.S. citizens for minor (although major for them) issues, like not saluting while a parade was going on. Nazi officials placated Dodd and others by promising these members would be brought to justice and that this type of behavior was an abnormality.<br/><br/>Major events leading up to the peak of Nazi Germany are discussed: purges (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives">Night of the Long Knives</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_in_Nazi_Germany#Laws">controversial laws</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#Dictatorship">changes in the governmental structure</a> (the most significant, in my opinion, was the death of German president Hindenburg and Hitler's immediate consolidation of the position of president and chancellor, which effectively gave him complete control of the government), and events that affected the U.S.-Germany relationship (1934 Mock Trial of Hitler), among many others.<br/><br/>In the Sources and Acknowledgment sections, Larson discusses his sources and which ones were more valuable for his "particular parcel of ground", rather than just general histories of Nazi Germany or WWII. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34442928-ambassador-dodd-s-diary?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nkLomb0q1e&rank=1"><i>Ambassador Dodd's Diary</i></a> (no reviews??) and Martha's memoir, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11726930-through-embassy-eyes?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kazTAuW6hp&rank=1"><i>Through Embassy Eyes</i></a>, were particularly helpful in getting a glimpse into both of their thought processes and obtaining direct quotes. University libraries (Yale, Harvard, Columbia) and public resources were also used. Larson explains his careful cross-examination of sources to verify information. This section is greatly appreciated - it gives credibility to the information and the further reading can be especially guiding to those interested in this topic/time period. A standard list of sources is included after the source discussion.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that provides a unique perspective that I, and likely many others, never considered.

Their approach to and mindset about training was quite different from Globo Gyms (of course) and even other non-conventional training methods, like Crossfit. You can see more about Gym Jones philosophy <a href="https://gymjones.com/knowledge/articles">here</a>.<br/><br/>Kiss or Kill is not a traditional book, but rather a series of Twight's essays concatenated together with pictures of various mountains, climbing, and other things, such as <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1066/1020/files/img086_Email_Lr.jpg?13387639341954045433">this photo</a>, captioned "Saying hello and goodbye to France, and the press in general." These essays were all penned pre-2001 (publication date), so Twight includes a "2000 Author's Note" at the end of each to reflect on what he thinks of the essays now and anything left unwritten.<br/><br/>The essays are a combination of Twight's philosophy and climbing stories (with his philosophy indirectly explained). <br/><br/>His <b>obsession</b> (that's what it is, no less) with climbing is impressive. He ruined relationships (both friendships and marriages) and risked in his life many a time in pursuit of pushing the limits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering#Alpine_style">alpining</a>. He remains cognizant of his decisions and how they affected both himself and others, yet continues in this fashion to keep doing what he loves: climbing mountains.<br/><br/>His writing is surprisingly good, both in describing his thought processes and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twight#Climbing">insane climbs he and others completed and attempted</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight">Twitching With Twight</a> (5 min read) does the best job of describing Twight's philosophy without embedding it into a climbing story. Twight lives by this without deviation. He learned the reality of his own selfishness. He lived with commitment to his climbing career and nothing else. Most importantly, he lived for himself and no one else (not surprisingly, he acknowledges Ayn Rand at the end).<br/><br/>Overall, any mountaineer/alpinist would likely enjoy this book for its history aspect (Twight made the first ascents on quite a few routes), while non-climbers may still find it interesting for its imagery. Climbing aside, everyone can learn something from his philosophy.</td></tr><tr><td>The A to Z of Sexspionage</td><td>Nigel West</td><td>4</td><td>Disclaimer: I did not read the entire book, just the "A" section and skimmed important cases from the remaining 25 sections (yes, it's literally A to Z).<br/><br/>The book begins with a chronology of major sexspionage cases and an introduction into what sexspionage is and how it's used in modern espionage.<br/><br/>The main part of the book is a comprehensive dictionary of sexspionage cases conducted by all nations (U.S., Russia, Cuba, etc). Each case is thoroughly detailed with names, dates, locations, explanations, and conclusions (to both the case itself and the individual). References to other cases are also included when applicable.<br/><br/>Important cases include the following: Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, Martin Luther King Jr., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>, and Leon Trotsky.

Their realizing that NK is not what the regime says is gradual. It begins with noticing the electricity is intermittent: sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. Then it progresses to lack of food and salary. (Their assigned jobs normally gave them paychecks and foodstamp-equivalents to pay for basic items and get their three daily meal.) Salaries dwindled down to nothing and foodstamps provided three, then two, then a measly one meal per day (and even that one meal regressed in size). Propaganda offset the frustration by encouraging one meal a day to help their country and blaming capitalism for preventing food deliveries. Black markets thrived, with authorities turning a blind eye, as they were also hungry.<br/><br/>Hunger was a large focus of the book. To make up for lack of food and lack of money to purchase food, people got creative (as we normally do when faced with a life-or-death situation). They traveled far into the countryside to raid orchards. They peeled bark off of trees, ground it into a coarse powder, then boiled it into soup, along with freshly-picked grass from the side of the road. They picked from the excrement of animals to salvage undigested food. Some opened up illegal gardens in their backyards. Roaming gangs of children, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotjebi">kotjebi</a>, would rush markets, knocking over the stall and its vendor and grabbing as much food as possible. Children were admitted to hospitals due to intense stomach aches caused by inedible items used as food that their immature stomachs couldn't process. Prostitution was common, with payment being in form of food.<br/><br/>Another focus was propaganda and the "brainwashing" (should that really be in quotes?) of the citizens. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim il-Sung</a> (the original leader of North Korea) died in 1994 and caused a week of lamentation across the entire country. People never considered the fact that their "Great Leader" (how they refer to him) could actually die. This caused huge concern about the future: if Kim il-Sung could die, anything could happen. Children were taught songs, one of which's had a phrase that included the title of the book. (I find this quite ironic, as it can take on two meanings. They are completely satisfied and have nothing they envy of others, or they have nothing that others would envy of them. The latter seems much more applicable.) To maintain the stature of the leader, insults or derogatory remarks about them resulted in hard labor camps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_North_Korea"> more on NK prisons here</a>) and even executions (which were performed regularly). Everyone was encouraged to spy on their neighbors for any signs of lack of allegiance.<br/><br/>One side note on NK giving up their nuclear weapons (briefly discussed in the book). I attended a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Lord">Winston Lord</a>, who is currently on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Human_Rights_in_North_Korea">U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a>. During the Q&A portion, someone asked his thoughts about the NK nuclear situation. He was firm in his response: NK will never give up their nuclear weapons. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi">Qaddafi</a> gave up his WMDs, we left him high and dry. NK apparently (I haven't been able to find a source - please reply to this if you can find one!) released an official statement saying something along the lines of "we now know what happens when a country gives up their WMDs". While I hope denuclearization does happen, I must agree with Lord. NK's WMDs and the supposed hundreds of missiles pointing at SK are the only things stopping the regime from being removed.</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesdays with Morrie</td><td>Mitch Albom</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</td><td>Christopher McDougall</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Catch-22 (Catch-22, #1)</td><td>Joseph Heller</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Amber Spyglass  (His Dark Materials, #3)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Son (The Giver Quartet, #4)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gossamer</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Soldiers Of Reason: The RAND Corporation And The Rise Of The American Empire</td><td>Alex Abella</td><td>3</td><td>Soldiers of Reason details the history of RAND, from its inception to modern times (well, 2008, when the book was published). Abella discusses and details both the important periods of time/events RAND was involved in (Cold War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, Iraq War, Watergate, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.), as well as the notable people involved (Henry Kissinger, Paul Wolfowitz and others) and the role they played in guiding both the organization itself and the government (exclusively the U.S., up until the 2000's) it served.<br/><br/>RAND, standing for Research ANd Development, was established to assist the U.S. Air Force in various research capacities. It attracted a wide-range of academics, from physicists to social scientists and everyone in between. Nuclear war was the primary focus in the early stages of RAND, where the researchers asked questions about preemptive strikes, strategic locations of munitions and vehicles, and the status of the Soviet's nuclear program. Game theory was researched by John Von Neumann (arguably the greatest polymath of all-time) and others to be applied to the Soviet threat.<br/><br/>During the Vietnam War, RAND analysts participated by interviewing North Vietnamese prisoners-of-war to learn about their motivation. After finding out that the Vietcong "described themselves as patriots leading a war of national liberation", the analysts realized the war would be a lot more difficult than initially anticipated. However, it was not their place to decide what was right or wrong, difficult or easy: their job was to synthesize the data and report it. Like America at the time, a large rift was created between RAND employees: pro-war and anti-war. Daniel Ellsberg, part of the anti-war faction, was the RAND employee who leaked what is known as the Pentagon Papers, documents detailing the truth on what the U.S. government was really doing in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In addition to international assignments, RAND also accepted commissions concerning domestic matters, such as one from New York City's mayor John Lindsay to study reformation of the city's unpopular government. Other federal entities, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have also sought RAND's abilities in improving their methods.<br/><br/>The book's last few chapters discuss terrorism and RAND's role in working with and assisting the U.S. government in combating it.<br/><br/>RAND is still alive and well today (rand.org). Their website details all of their research areas and divisions, the reports they publish, the experts they employ, and their abilities. They even have a graduate school for public policy.<br/><br/>Despite being mostly in the shadows, RAND has and will continue to play a large (the importance is subjective) role in shaping and guiding U.S. policy for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Overall, a run-of-the-mill nonfiction book detailing the history of a company.

Little to no technical background is required to understand the technology discussed, although it certainly doesn't hurt. <br/><br/>The book details the investigation (and obsession) of Stuxnet by a select number of security researchers and firms spread across the world. Zetter describes the researchers' process into dissecting the incredibly complex <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2010-071400-3123-99">Stuxnet code</a> (I suggest reading through this link, as Symantec was one of those "select number of security researchers and firms") and how they were finally able to understand its final payload.<br/><br/>U.S. cybersecurity and cyberwarfare policy, general cyber "philosophy" (for lack of a better term), and the legality of cyber operations are also discussed. Should zero-day exploits be able to be sold to the highest bidder, whether that be a nation-state or terror group? Do zero-day researchers have an obligation to disclose said exploit to the respective software? How should we respond to zero-day offensives aimed at the U.S? (Hint: depending on the severity of the attack, it may be considered an act of war, and you don't want to be on the wrong side of America when that happens.) Zetter describes what the U.S.' current policy is towards these questions and what discussions are taking place, albeit behind closed doors. <br/><br/>Even if you don't care about the Stuxnet virus or its impact, the cyber aspect of the book is extremely important to understand in this day and age. Our lives are becoming evermore electronically interconnected (phones connect to computers to cars to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-refrigerator-4158327">refrigerators</a> (wait, what?) to watches), and with it comes vulnerabilities. While those are small-scale connections, compromising large-scale systems has the potential to kill individuals and ravage society: economic markets, power grids, transportation networks, healthcare systems, and computing centers. While there is little ordinary citizens can do to help prevent this, it helps to be informed on issues like this.</td></tr><tr><td>Number the Stars</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Tale of Despereaux</td><td>Kate DiCamillo</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The City of Ember (Book of Ember, #1)</td><td>Jeanne DuPrau</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</td><td>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</td><td>5</td><td>Review summary: An enjoyable (can I say that with what this book is about?) read about a horrific historical time period. Solzhenitsyn, with the translation help of Willetts, does a good job of describing the human condition in the face of evil and how it was managed over many years.<br/><br/>The book accounts details the fictional Ivan Denisovich's (Shukhov, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Slavic_naming_customs">Slavic naming conventions</a> can help here, and in other Russian novels) experiences in one of Stalin's forced labor camps. Forced to confess he was a German spy, this account was taken during around his seventh year in prison.<br/><br/>Despite the horrible conditions they faced, there was plenty of time for happiness to be felt in the form of tobacco, warmth, and Sundays off (quite similar to what non-prisoners enjoy!). As the final paragraph begins: "Shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep. A lot of good things had happened that day." An important lesson can be learned from this: despite harrowing conditions, happiness can still be felt in the form of hope (e.g. your prison sentence ending) or temporary relief (e.g. a cigarette). <br/><br/>The treatment of the prisoners was better than what I was expecting, although I'm not sure how much was censored by the USSR. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956?ac=1&from_search=true">Gulag Archipelago</a>, also by Solzhenitsyn, is supposedly more brutal and uncensored than <i>One Day</i>, which, not coincidentally, he was not allowed to publish in the USSR.<br/><br/>While I'm not a Russian speaker, Willetts seemed to do an adequate job of translating the humor and messages (after all, it's the only authorized version of this book).<br/><br/><i>One Day</i> and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> are two important books about a terrible time in world history. OD is a bit more accessible (shorter, less descriptive), while TGA is out of reach/interest for many readers (~2000 pages across three volumes, vivid imagery = darker). I will tackle TGA at some point and compare with this.<br/><br/>For historical background, Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">Gulag</a> article is well-researched, descriptive, and comprehensive if you are looking to learn more about this time period.</td></tr><tr><td>Being Peace (Being Peace, #1)</td><td>Thich Nhat Hanh</td><td>2</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Sound and the Fury</td><td>William Faulkner</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Brave New World</td><td>Aldous Huxley</td><td>4</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10</td><td>Marcus Luttrell</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Godfather</td><td>Mario Puzo</td><td>5</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Radioactivity: A History of a Mysterious Science</td><td>Marjorie C.

In the helicopter ride-along he learns about the ideal city layout for policing, and other small bits of knowledge about "bulgar theory" and policing methods.<br/><br/>A good portion of the book consists of anecdotes to complement his learnings and give some practical (although some of them are not so practical!) examples of real-life burglaries. He discusses tunneling into bank vaults (<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/thieves-use-sewage-pipes-tunnels-to-break-into-bank-vault-full-of-jewels-in-antwerps-diamond-district"> yes, this does happen</a>) and using social engineering to fool companies into sending you master key cards.<br/><br/>Manaugh briefly discusses the legal theory behind burglary. What is considered a building? When and where are you considered to be "inside" of a building? Some states take into account intent, meaning if you have suspicious items on you, despite a perfectly good explanation for each, you can still be charged with a crime.<br/><br/>An important topic discussed towards the book's end is that of "<a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2010/01/nakatomi-space/">Nakatomi Space</a>", named after the plaza in the movie Die Hard, where the protagonist travels around a skyscraper uses everything <u>but</u> conventional methods. The independent research Gwern discusses Nakatomi Space and some of its applications in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c0nqg7/people_seem_to_think_thieves_should_lockpick_or/er6huvz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app">this Reddit comment</a>.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway from this book is using objects in manners they are <u>not</u> meant to be used in, e.g. enter a room through the thin drywall rather than the reinforced steel door with three deadbolts and a booby trap. It is through this outside-of-the-box thinking that the most successful burglars have gotten away with crimes.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</td><td>Alexandra David-Néel</td><td>5</td><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet provides an excellent summary of Tibetan practices, beliefs, and culture in the beginning of the 20th century. If anyone has a suggestion for a more modern book detailing similar information, I'd love to hear it.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_David-N%C3%A9el">Alexandra David-Néel</a> is a French linguist and Buddhist who has spent significant time traveling in and around Tibet.<br/><br/>The book is split up into eight chapters: Tibet and the Lamas, A Guest of the Lamas, A Famous Tibetan Monastery, Dealing with Ghosts and Demons, Disciples of Yore and Their Contemporary Emulators, Psychic Sports, Mystic Theories and Spiritual Training, and Psychic Phenomena in Tibet - How Tibetans Explain Them.<br/><br/>Each chapter is a mix of her travels in Tibet and Tibetan practices as they relate to the chapter's title. She gives detailed background information about the practices: how they began, what Tibetans believe about them, and how the practices are actually performed. Take, for example,  <i> lung-gom </i>, a type of training that is said to "develop uncommon nimbleness and especially enables its adepts to take extraordinarily long tramps with amazing rapidity". David-Néel describes her interactions with <i> lung-gom-pas </i>, first encountering one in Chang thang of Northern Tibet, then another who was wearing iron chains to prevent himself from floating off into space (since the training supposedly makes you lighter than air). She then describes the training itself: jumping cross-legged from the bottom of a pit and crawling through a minuscule hole from a cell they've been in for seven days. Throughout these descriptions, she explains the Tibetans' reasoning and thoughts behind why and how these work. Complementary anecdotes and folklore are also shared throughout the book. This process is used for the most of the Tibetan practices and culture she describes.<br/><br/>There is a lot of mysticism and spiritual belief that David-Néel does a good (and respectful) job of not diminishing, but rather objectively explains their perspective. The book ends in a request for scientists to "undertake serious investigations of the phenomena [which David-Néel experienced]", as some of the events she describes are seemingly unexplainable. Considering this was written in the 1930s, I am curious to see how much, if any, Tibetan beliefs have changed in regard to these subjects since then.<br/><br/>There is little concept of time throughout (no "in 19XX I did this"), but she does mention this book is the culmination of over 10 years of research and studying.<br/><br/>Pictures are mostly of persons, but also include some places.</td></tr><tr><td>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society</td><td>Dave Grossman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger (The Giver, #3)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>I Am the Messenger</td><td>Markus Zusak</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Notebook of Leonardo Da Vinci</td><td>Leonardo da Vinci</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Extraordinary Voyages, #6)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Mysterious Island (Extraordinary Voyages, #12)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Pearl</td><td>John Steinbeck</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again</td><td>J.R.R.
