<table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Author</th><th>My Rating</th><th>My Review</th></tr><tr><td>Jarhead : A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles</td><td>Anthony Swofford</td><td>3</td><td>War can be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/45446-it-is-only-those-who-have-neither-fired-a-shot">hell</a> for multiple reasons. Most think of the gruesome fighting. The bullets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRvRG7tMCdA">whizzing and cracking</a> past your ear, the smell of gunpowder and death and blood overwhelming the nostrils, the smoke clouding your vision, the fear that disables all bladder and bowel control, the thoughts of your past and future experiences that haven't happened yet and at this rate won't. But there is another hell people don't know about or even consider: the non-combative hell, the hell where you don't experience your expectations and are disappointed more than you thought possible.<br/><br/>Imagine this: from a young age you dream of being a [insert career path here]. You read all the books and watch all the television shows that glorify that career and give you a false notion as to what it entails and how many women will be obsessing over you. As you grow older, you begin to train and invest precious youthful time to best prepare you, whether it be lifting weights or studying or practicing a craft. Finally, the momentous day comes: you've accepted the job offer. Your family and friends are there in support and cheer as your dream of over a decade has come to fruition. You are excited for what the future holds. You aren't jaded. Yet.<br/><br/>You begin job-specific training and learn the tricks of the trade, the do's and dont's. You continue training and refining your skills, ready to be called upon to serve the purpose you've been waiting for for the majority of your life. Months or years may go by before that happens, but the day finally comes: you've been called to serve your [company/country/community]. You enthusiastically follow your colleagues to the area of operation and patiently wait for further orders. It's so close, and you've waited so long, what's a few more days? You continue perfecting your skills, ready to demonstrate them to your hard-ass boss on a moment's notice. Your mind is calm and collected. This is what you've been bred, raised, and trained to do. The moment is nigh, and you are about to carpe the ever-living [your choice of expletive here] out of it. It's all anybody can talk about, interrupting sleep to stay up late talking about what's going to happen and how they're going to do it and why they want to do it. There's variations to the predicted events and reasons each gives, but at the core they're all the same.<br/><br/>But days turn to weeks, and weeks to months as you wonder where the action the smooth-talking guy promised you when you talked about the job with childish excitement in your voice and a reptilian gleam in his eyes. Excitement turns to boredom turns to anger. You've been lied to, bamboozled, fooled, used, tricked out of a life of glamour and being the hero the TV said you would be. You still train, but it's not the same. Before it was for a purpose, but now there's no purpose. You realize the training was never going to be used, it was just a ploy to motivate you. How could you be so naive and blind?<br/><br/>You return home to your family and friends and acquaintances, who view you with a halo on your head and a heavenly glow surrounding your body: you're a <i>hero</i>. You keep a straight face that conceals your disagreement and disillusionment, understanding there's no way to change this narrative. They won't be able to understand what you went through. The years of excitement building up, only to have it come crashing down in a few short, boring, life-changing weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>Raise a Genius!</td><td>László Polgár</td><td>4</td><td><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/genius.pdf">English translation here</a>, funded by the blog Slate Star Codex (SSC author's review <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/31/book-review-raise-a-genius/">here</a>.)<br/><br/>For those that don't know, this book is written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r">Lázló Polgár</a>, a Hungarian who trained all three of his daughters to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)">chess Grandmasters</a>. His youngest, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r">Judit</a>, is considered the best female chess player of all-time.<br/><br/>Polgar's method for raising a genius is relatively straightforward and devised from the upbringings of other so-called geniuses (Polgar researched many childhoods in preparation for his own children's). Start young, specialize in a specific topic, and continue studying and refining specialization. After reading this, most people would have an image of an abusive father disciplining his children for only studying chess openings for 6 hours that day, not 7—but Polgar is quite the opposite: he focused on ensuring his children's happiness alongside their success, not just the latter. The children <i>want</i> to play and learn chess for both themselves and their father, and do not feel forced or pressured into doing so. He balances failures and successes in a 1:10 ratio, allowing the children to experience what it's like to fail while still gaining self-confidence through successes. They should be praised often for their work, not to inflate their ego, but to make them feel worthy as a competitor and peer, not just a child.<br/><br/>Starting young is due to Polgar's belief (he cites the 1) WHO's Barnet (can't find source) saying that "the first five years of life are most important in forming a person’s behavior," and 2) B. Bloom's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1568654.Stability_And_Change_In_Human_Characteristics?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=BiklTmUMQB&rank=1"><i>Stability and Change in Human Characteristics</i></a>, which says that "50% of a person’s intellect is formed during the first four years of life, and a child’s extraordinary ability to understand, typical until four years of age, little by little decreases with the passage of time") that after childhood, the brain's ability to learn new skills drastically diminishes, e.g., learning a foreign language is much more difficult for adults than young children. To take advantage of this time, Polgar started his children at the ripe age of 3. He begins with basic instruction in foreign languages (his top choice was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a> for its simplicity and cultural significance, but the girls also speak Russian) and moves on to basic games to pique the child's interest. Serious training begins around the age of 6 and continues from there.<br/><br/>Polgar chose his children's specialization as chess, but also proposes mathematics, physics, music, and foreign languages. This decision needs to be made at a young age (3-4), so as not to waste any of their precious enhanced-development time.<br/><br/>In continuing their chess specialization, Polgar had them playing chess 5-6 hours per day from the age of 4-5. One clarification on the word "playing" in the previous sentence: while "playing" is grammatically correct and it is not referred to as "training" or "working" chess, it was still "play" in the true sense of the noun: the girls were having fun while continuing to develop their abilities to high levels. This perception of play is crucial to the development of a genius, as it prevents burnout and boredom from occurring. A typical day for his children consists of "4 hours of specialist study, 1 hour of a foreign language, 1 hour of a general study (native language, natural science and social studies), 1 hour of computing, 1 hour of moral, psychological, and pedagogical studies (humor lessons as well), [and] 1 hour of gymnastics". A full day! But going back to the use of "playing", these days are enjoyable. The girls enjoy learning new chess openings, or how to converse in Esperanto, or a new joke.<br/><br/>While this specialization is exclusive to one field, hence the term "specialization", it does make the acquisition of other skills easier through the use of learning heuristics. It's often said the the knowledge learned in university may not be directly applicable to a career, but the problem-solving skills learned will be. Polgar states the same thing. By achieving a high level in one field and "learn[ing] how to learn", picking up new skills will be easier.<br/><br/>Polgar often claims that he himself can raise anybody to be a genius given full reign of their environment, especially the social aspect: "Genius is not born, genius is raised." The nature crowd from the nature vs. nurture debate will have a pretty big issue with this. He cites Watson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson#%22Twelve_infants%22">twelve infants</a>" quote, in which the famous psychologist boasts he can raise any one of them into a "specialist...regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors."<br/><br/>Even if Polgar's claims about the guarantee of raising a genius using similar methods, the child raised will still be an outstanding citizen. Polgar preaches morality as the foundation of genius, and views it as a major factor in the development of genius. He describes his qualities of a moral genius as follows: "I see before me a person who is sacrificial, honest, and courageous; a good friend and family member, not cynical, not egotistical, but empathetic and good-hearted, who feels responsibility, is attentive, and is capable of keeping secrets, who does not misuse their power, does not gossip, and can master their ambition, who is just, demands quality, an internationalist and not envious, who generally behaves in a friendly way and does not judge others easily, who is persistent, has initiative, conscious of duty, critical, self-critical and conscientious, who relates well to learning or ignorance, and who is capable of self-education (self-perfection), who has self-control, who is sincere and strives for freedom for themself and others, whose ethics are at a similarly high level, who is modest, able to love others, who has solidarity, tolerance and politeness, has a healthy competitiveness, is helpful, peaceful, and well-intentioned, who shows respect to those who merit it, etc. This kind of person is definitely an exemplary moral authority. Whoever has in themselves all of the qualities above to a high level is a moral genius, even if they never become a hero, and even if those around them never consider them to be one." Try to find an undesirable quality in the above description—it's impossible.<br/><br/>Polgar does not shy away from criticisms of his system (there are many, including from the Hungarian government itself), but answers them thoughfully and completely. Hungary originally tried to suppress the Polgar sisters' successes, but thankfully did not succeed. He is especially critical of modern educational systems in regards to learning, stating the children see no obvious purpose in learning. In his system, they see tangible progress and become more motivated, creating a perpetual cycle of learning. I must agree with him here. Are "international and cultural diversity" credits (as my university referred to them) truly necessary? What is the purpose of making them a mandatory part of a degree program? To make sure I'm a well-rounded citizen of society? Who's to say I'm not already? Anything worth learning should have a purpose to it, else it seems fruitless and motivations wanes. He also sees educational systems as catering to the lowest common denominator, preventing potential geniuses from succeeding and fulfilling said potential. This was one of the principal reasons he chose to self-teach his girls.<br/><br/>The book is organized in a question-answer fashion, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endre_Farkas">Endre Farkas</a> acting as the interviewer.<br/><br/>While I am no parent, it seems reasonable enough to suggest that most people should read this book. Outside of the genius education part, Polgar makes a compelling case on ways to raise a child to be well-rounded in ethics, morals, intelligence, work ethic, and any other venture they attempt.</td></tr><tr><td>Flowers for Algernon</td><td>Daniel Keyes</td><td>4</td><td>A deeply moving story about a mentally retarded adult's journey from retardation to genius and back, complete with experiences of love, realization, learning, self-reflection, success, and failure. The writing is masterful—Keyes is able to gradually display Charlie's ever-increasing intelligence just through writing. He begins learning punctuation, remembers the correct spelling of words, and makes connections with the real world.<br/><br/>I especially liked the adherence to the hypothesis: "artificially-induced intelligence deteriorates at a rate of time directly proportional to the quantity of the increase". In laymen terms, if you gain a significant amount of intelligence from the surgery, expect to lose it quickly when you start to lose it. Charlie is sadly proven correct: while his initial intelligence gain was slow, his decline was quick, taking a short two months, from mid-September to mid-November, peak to original standing.</td></tr><tr><td>The Outsiders</td><td>S.E. Hinton</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Class: A Guide Through the American Status System</td><td>Paul Fussell</td><td>1</td><td>I wasn't alive in 1982, so I don't have much say as to how relevant it was then (almost 40 years ago!), but it is largely, if not entirely, irrelevant now. Fussell illustrates the various U.S. class systems primarily through examples, looking at anatomy, appearances, homes, consumption and recreation, mental state and tendencies, and speech. The last two chapters discuss the difficulty in changing classes, especially the improvement part.<br/><br/>If you are to take two things from this book, the first is that class is largely signaling. People want to appear healthier, wealthier, more well-read, etc., than their neighbors and friends. Stop trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses">keep up with the Joneses</a> and live your life. The second is that people of different classes view the so-called requirement to join each class as different. Upper class, while having money, views their class as one based on behaviors. The source of the money is also a factor: those that inherited their bank accounts' nine digits are considered a higher class than those that earned it through business ventures. Middle class believes in both education and money. Low class believes almost entirely in money. Fussell gives an example of two people that make the same amount of money: one is a white-collar worker, the other blue-collar. Their differences lie in their interests and behaviors. The white-collar worker drinks a "classier" cocktail than the blue-collar's cheap light beer. The white-collar worker has a decent-sized library, whereas the blue-collar worker can't remember the last time he read a book, much less owned one.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy this book. I made it through about 50 pages before realizing its irrelevancy, especially in its endless examples, and skimming the rest.</td></tr><tr><td>The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America</td><td>Erik Larson</td><td>2</td><td><i>The Devil in the White City</i> consists of two stories that overlap slightly: the life and murders committed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes">Dr. H. H. Holmes</a> and the inception, development, creation, and operation of the 1893 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition">World's Fair</a> (also called the World's Columbian Fair, in recognition of Columbus' discovery of America 400 years earlier,  and Chicago's World Fair).<br/><br/>Larson shows us the immense amount of planning and organization that went in to building the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition#White_City">White City</a>" and the various obstacles and setbacks encountered. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">planning fallacy</a>, which was inconveniently proposed well after the Fair took place.<br/><br/>Holmes' life is also examined, beginning with his formative years to his time as one of the country's most prolific serial killers and con artists (he also committed large amounts of insurance fraud).<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy the book like I did Larson's other, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9938498-in-the-garden-of-beasts"><i>In the Garden of Beasts</i></a> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3070280598?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1">review here</a>), but I suggest reading it if you enjoy his writing style. It provides an excellent glimpse into what life was like back then.<br/><br/>Some great pictures of the Fair can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1893+world+fair&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjXptWVhqLpAhUVL60KHcuXA6QQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=1893+world+fair&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQQzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgQIABAeUPIoWPIoYJcraABwAHgAgAFuiAFukgEDMC4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=pSa0XpfAKJXetAXLr46gCg&bih=714&biw=1280">here</a>. You can also find the architectural plans and blueprints at the Library of Congress <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t8nc6vd53&view=1up&seq=7">here</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Enter the Zone</td><td>Barry Sears</td><td>3</td><td>Interesting proposal by Sears: simply keep percentages of carbohydrate/protein/fat to 40/30/30% and you will remain in the Zone. Sears presents the science behind the diet and exactly how it works (hormonal responses). Literature is cited at the end of the book.<br/><br/>I plan to run a month-long experiment in October 2020 to test Sears' claims. Will update this review accordingly.</td></tr><tr><td>A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology</td><td>John F. O'Hanlon</td><td>4</td><td>You can read my <a href="https://ethanmorse.github.io/research/vacuum/vacuum.html">full summary here</a> (website is unadvertised). It includes some things I felt were important that O'Hanlon left out and excludes some things from the book I felt weren't as important if you have a basic physics/chemistry background, e.g., gas properties).<br/><br/>If your career deals with vacuum, read this book cover-to-cover. O'Hanlon begins with the basics of gases (their properties, flow regimes, relation with solids) and progresses to actual vacuum concepts. The mathematics behind vacuum are included with explanations, as well as lay-person descriptions. While the descriptions are nice, I encourage the reader to search the internet for videos of how the various pumps operate, as it is much clearer than words and a static figure.<br/><br/>Third edition should be purchased if possible—the second edition was published before the invention of some important technology, e.g., scroll pumps.</td></tr><tr><td>The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir</td><td>Philip J. Guo</td><td>3</td><td>(Short disclaimer: I am not nor have ever been a graduate student, but worked extensively around  a wide range of STEM Ph.D. students (over 100 total) at a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings">top 20 in engineering U.S. university</a> for three years).<br/><br/>The book is short (took me about two hours to read) and discusses Guo's experiences as a Ph.D. student in computer science at one of the U.S.' most prestigious universities. Each of his six years has one chapter devoted to it: projects worked on, individuals met, mindset (happy, burnt out, frustrated, etc), and vision for the future. The epilogue includes 20 lessons Guo learned and serves as a good, high-level summary of his graduate studies.<br/><br/>Academia has a lot of intricacies that generally aren't understood and can't be learned by outsiders—in order to understand, one has to be a part of a research group. Guo offers a vicarious glimpse into what academia is: he explains what certain things mean, why things are the way they are, and the reasons he did things.<br/><br/>This is an especially valuable read for anyone considering entering into a Ph.D. program. While this is only one individual's experience, I know of others who have had very similar times in graduate school.<br/><br/>Here is a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/951815008">negative review</a> of the book. Reading the review prior to the book and keeping it mind may be helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>A Message to Garcia</td><td>Elbert Hubbard</td><td>4</td><td>More of a parable than entire book, <i>A Message to Garcia</i> is meant to illustrate the virtue of initiative when given a task.<br/><br/>I've seen it myself firsthand: someone is told to complete task, and replies with a barrage of questions that are easily answered with 10 minutes of cursory Google searches. Is it laziness that causes this? Does the task-doer just want most of the job to be done for him, so he can move on to more interesting (at least to him) things? This is absolutely part of it. What about selfishness and fairness? Does the task-doer want the task-master to take some amount of ownership in the task, since he seems to be doing nothing other than ordering his inferiors around? This is a plausible explanation, but one likely taken by the ignorant (although in some cases this absolutely can be true): the task-master likely has higher-level tasks needing to be done, and delegation is a great tool for improving efficiency. The last cause can be attributed to ignorance. The task-doer simply doesn't know that he can find the answers to his questions independently, leading him to ask his questions. This should be explained and forgiven only once: show him how to find answers, and for any questions asked for future tasks, precede the answers with a simple counter-questions: have you tried searching for it?<br/><br/>There are controversial views present (especially in the age of mega-corporations and their inhumane treatment of their serva...employees), but they are mostly reflected at small businesses with direct relationships between the head honcho and the employees. Regardless, some quotes: (1) "My heart goes out to the man who does his work when the “boss” is away, as well as when he is at home." (2) "I know one man of really brilliant parts who has not the ability to manage a business of his own, and yet who is absolutely worthless to any one else, because he carries with him constantly the insane suspicion that his employer is oppressing, or intending to oppress, him." Oh, how Hubbard would be surprised. (3) "I think if I worked for a man, I would work for him. I would not work for him a part of his time, but all of his time. I would give an undivided service or none."<br/><br/>The message is still relevant, but some parts dated and no longer applicable to life now. The story and its apologia can be read for free and in less than 15 minutes <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17195/17195-h/17195-h.htm">here on Project Gutenberg</a>. Another nice resource is <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/">lmgtfy</a> (let me Google that for you), whose motto is "For all those people who find it more convenient to bother you with their question rather than search it for themselves."</td></tr><tr><td>War and peace / Leo Tolstoy ; translated from the Russian by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky</td><td>Leo Tolstoy</td><td>5</td><td><i>War and Peace</i> is often acclaimed as one of, if not the, <a href="https://thegreatestbooks.org/items/116">greatest novels of all-time</a>, as evident by the high-ranking and sheer number of "best book" lists it makes it on, including Bloom's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20941.The_Western_Canon?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=hsvns1hWJT&rank=1"><i>Western Canon</i></a>. This claim is not an opinion, nor can it be argued, questioned, or debated—it just is, and only those who have read this masterpiece will be able to comprehend this fact.<br/><br/>Tolstoy explores a plethora (but not to excess) of themes through the perspective of five aristocratic Russian families and their relations during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>: Bolkónsky, Rostov, Bezúkhov, Kurágin, and Drubetskóy. And despite being written 150 years ago, these motifs still directly apply to 21st-century life. Past generations are often looked at differently than the current generation—the current gen'ers think their parents can't and don't and won't possibly understand what is going on, can't <i>possibly</i> put themselves in their position, can't feel what they are feeling—but how they are mistaken. Some experiences transcend the time period, the social status, the location that people think make them unique and unlike anybody else. Tolstoy recognizes this fact of life while looking back from the 1860s onto the 1800-1820s, masterfully discussing the bravery required during times of war; the passion one feels towards a lover both in and out of their presence; financial stress and its toll on mental and physical health; the concept of love, not just of a spouse, but of comrades, family members, and humanity in general; the difference between free will and consciousness and their role in contributing to history; teenage infatuation and mistaking it for love and allowing it to engulf your thoughts and body and actions and life and being, only to eventually to realize it's not what it was nor will it ever be that; the concept of being good and doing good for their intrinsic value, not for some underlying purpose; the desire for glory and fame amongst one's peers and countrymen and family and the fine line between courage and sheer recklessness in the attempt to achieve it; the sense of identity one feels with their nation and their people and their desire to contribute to and support that identity through the participation of war; the need for revenge after one has been wronged and the forgiveness that some choose to give towards the offender; the love of God and all His doings; the feeling of needing to take action, even when the event that the action is acting upon is already in motion and the action one proposes will serve little to no purpose except making them feel and look better; the facade of strength one puts on to ward off an enemy, despite being crippled internally; the concession of valuables in exchange for a later, but more valuable result; the standing up against adversity for what one knows and believes is the right action, regardless of the difficulty of the decision; the momentum one feels from victories, the dejection one feels from losses, and the contribution each has on the psyche and performance of an individual in future ventures. These are only some of the themes within this beautiful work and are much more elegantly expressed and developed within the pages.<br/><br/>The final part (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm#link2H_4_0370">Epilogue: Part Two</a> (note that this is not the Pevear-Vorohonsky translation, but the gist is understood)) is the most significant of all of the volumes and parts and worth reading in and of itself. Tolstoy discusses power, free will, causes, and their roles in shaping and driving history forward. After examining the former two, he asks and promptly answers the "two essential questions of history: (1) What is power? and (2) What force produces the movement of peoples?" In regards to power, "power is that relation of a certain person to other persons in which the person takes the less part in the action the more he expresses opinions, suppositions, and justifications for the jointly accomplished action." Tolstoy uses the standard military model to exemplify power—the commander-in-chief takes the least part of action and the most of expressing his opinion (giving orders), the generals have a bit more action and less opinion, and so on and so forth all the way down to the infantry, where they perform all the action and have little to no opinion in the grand scheme of things. In regards to the force, "the movement of peoples is produced, not by power, not by intellectual activity, not even by a combination of the two,...but by the activity of <i>all</i> the people taking part in the event and always joining together in such a way that those who take the greatest direct part in the event, take the least responsibility upon themselves, and vice versa." This definition is a bit opaque, allowing it to serve as a segue into the second part of Part Two: free will. Do humans truly have free will? is a question that has plagued philosophers since the beginning. We believe in and trust the natural laws that govern physical objects, e.g., gravity, but refuse to accept that man's will may be governed by a set of natural laws that, despite not being seen nor understood, act upon us as <a href="https://www.history.com/news/did-an-apple-really-fall-on-isaac-newtons-head">gravity does an apple</a>. Tolstoy distinguishes between consciousness (our ability to lift our arm when told to) and free will (the ability to direct our paths in life): consciousness is completely within reach of the individual, while free will is out of reach and dictated by history.<br/><br/>What causes history to occur? Is it the leaders of men, like Napoleon or Alexander I? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a> states that "history can be largely explained by the impact of great men". Tolstoy rejects this notion, instead proposing that no event has a single cause, but rather a multitude of smaller causes. While some view event X as the cause of of event Z, others may have a different perspective and see event Y as the cause of event Z. Does this mean one of them is wrong? Possibly. But one cause may not be mutually exclusive with another. One can go down the line of causes, finding a chain reaction that never ends. This is Tolstoy's grievance with (some) historians: they attempt to ascribe a single cause to the happening of something, not taking into account the many factors that contribute. When these factors align by coincidence is when great events occurs. For example, take a 20-digit combination lock, where the unlocking is a great event and the individual numbers are causes in the form of events. It takes all twenty numbers to align for the lock to open, but none of the individual numbers were the deciding factor in the event happening.<br/><br/>Tolstoy does not consider <i>War and Peace</i> a novel, nor an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry">epic</a>, nor a historical chronicle, nor really fit for any set genre of literature. Instead, it's in its own category altogether, mixing and refining a variety of literary genres to create the 1200+ page (translation-dependent) work.<br/><br/>Translations are a tricky and often controversial subject. Some readers swear by one translator, while others condemn that translator for their lack of accuracy and inability to convey the subtleties that author originally meant to express in the native version of the work. Pevear is a low-level Russian speaker and native English speaker and Volokhonsky is a native Russian speaker and high-level English speaker. (I can't find any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">CEFR results</a> from either Pevear or Volokhonsky, but based on interviews I've watched, she has a strong grasp of English and he has been said to be <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars">non-conversational</a> in Russian, implying some proficiency.) Together they have a comprehensive, close-to-foolproof method of translating. Volokhonsky goes through the novel's Russian version and translates it directly to English, along with notes about the author's intricate meanings and verbiage within the text: What did Tolstoy really mean by that? How does Dostoevsky's use of this specific phrase contribute to the atmosphere of the passage? Pevear then cleans up her direct translation into more fluid English. Volokhonsky checks his new-and-improved translation and they continue to refine it until the English version matches the Russian version in all details, such as tone, meaning, etc. This exchange of accuracy and nuance continues a few more times in either direction, until they are satisfied. Pevear then reads the newly-translated English version to Volokhonsky while she simultaneously reads the original Russian. This method is advantageous for two obvious reasons. First, there are native speakers of both languages checking the original and checking the translation, producing two checkpoints in which errors can be detected. The native part is crucial. Other translators, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Garnett">Garnett</a>, learned the from-language later in life (Garnett began learning Russian at the ripe age of 30), which many believe to be less efficient and effective than learning them as a child. (This has been refuted by some, but by-and-large remains true: I nor anyone in my close friend group know anyone who has learned another language past the age of 20 to the fluency required to make an accurate translation. And yet, most bilingual speakers learned their languages at a young age.) Garnett's late-learning shows in her criticisms by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GwfplQ3OK8EC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=nabokov+on+garnett+dry+and+flat&source=bl&ots=m7gEg1cnEk&sig=ACfU3U27zRicnxvo_yS8WSNSmfpuhjcM7w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid_rnrnpDpAhVJ-6wKHX8HA_sQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nabokov%20on%20garnett%20dry%20and%20flat&f=false">Nabokov</a>. Second, and an extension of the first, there are more checkpoints for errors to be detected. No first draft is ever perfect (Tolstoy is reported to have written seven drafts for <i>War and Peace</i>!), and both errors and improvements can be found when making multiple passes. With all this being said and while I suggest Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation, I encourage you to do your research on translations and choose the one you think is best.<br/><br/>Russian novels, and this book in particular, are infamous for giving readers trouble when it comes to names. After a few hundred pages, the many relations are clear, but it definitely helps to have a loose sheet at the ready. If the book includes the list, bookmark that for quick reference.<br/><br/>The length is no doubt daunting, but the story is engrossing enough that the number of pages becomes irrelevant. All you begin to care about is what happens next, not that you have 800 pages left. I personally tend to get bored after around 400-500 pages—get to the point! Not with <i>War and Peace</i>. The length allows Tolstoy's thoughts to develop at their own pace—they're not hurried because the book is getting too long.<br/><br/>This book should be and needs to be read by all, whether interested in literature or not. The themes are timeless, the writing superb, and the story riveting.</td></tr><tr><td>Death of a Salesman</td><td>Arthur  Miller</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Hound of the Baskervilles</td><td>Arthur Conan Doyle</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>A Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes, #1)</td><td>Arthur Conan Doyle</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Much Ado About Nothing</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Crucible</td><td>Arthur  Miller</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Macbeth</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Romeo and Juliet</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Silent World</td><td>Jacques-Yves Cousteau</td><td>3</td><td>If news broke today that an eighth continent had been found, tens of thousands would flock to their nearest airport for a chance to experience this unexplored territory.

Later, while watching traditional Mediterranean fishing from below (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5KWbc_iXCQ">video here</a>, note it may be a bit offensive to some), Cousteau expresses his desire to free the fish from their ever-tightening graveyard.<br/><br/>After reading this, I plan to do some SCUBA diving at some point, preferably in the Caribbean or Mediterranean.</td></tr><tr><td>The Snakehead: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream</td><td>Patrick Radden Keefe</td><td>3</td><td>The term snakehead refers to a Chinese person who facilitates the smuggling of fellow Chinese into other countries, namely Western nations. The use of the verb "smuggling" should be noted here, as smuggling and trafficking are not synonymous. Smuggling is the illegal transportation of a cooperative person from location A to location B. Trafficking is the illegal transportation of an uncooperative person from location A to location B and generally involves sex and/or slavery, among other things. All of the people in this book were smuggled into the U.S. willingly and without coercion.<br/><br/>The book revolves around two things: The most famous of snakeheads, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Ping">Cheng Chui Ping</a> (image <a href="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590951662179605b11ad2fe2/1:1/w_290,h_290,c_limit/sister-ping.jpg">here</a>, more commonly known by her moniker Sister Ping and the incident of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Venture"><i>Golden Venture</i></a>.<br/><br/>Born in Fujian, China (where a majority of snakeheads are from), Sister Ping immigrated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan">New York City's Chinatown</a> to run a shop, while also smuggling as her side hustle with her husband. She charged over $30,000 USD for a single person to be smuggled. Being from Fujian in that time generally meant that you were poor, an agreement was made: pay a small down payment, then pay the remaining balance after you got into the U.S. The remaining balance was paid through underground labor, e.g. dishwashing. Sister Ping's reputation was impeccable. She got people in safely and with money-back guarantee. As time progressed, other snakeheads got into the game, hopeful of the riches that came with the business. Snakeheads worked together to board people onto a common ship, making a single run cheaper than it would have been individually. Some even feigned association with Sister Ping to make their business seem more credible to prospective customers.<br/><br/>The Golden Venture was a cargo ship that intentionally ran aground outside of New York City. Almost 300 illegal aliens were on board and jumped ship in their attempt to make it to the promised land that was the U.S. Those that did not drown (10) or were not caught (not sure the number here) were taken to various prisons throughout the U.S. to await sentencing. It was here that they applied for asylum. Here is where it gets tricky. Snakeheads had taught their customers how to essentially guarantee their asylum request was granted. Just say you were persecuted in China and/or that you feared for your life, and bam! you can stay. This is problematic for obvious reasons. How are these claims meant to be verified? Lawyers and law enforcement have a few methods to check the aliens' veracity: Repeat what they said back to them, but change a small detail (if they confirm your sentence, then it contradicts what they just said). Ask them about something they said a few days ago and see if the story changes. Cross-examine other witnesses or official accounts. Even then, the possibility remains that some are just excellent liars or just really stuck to their script (after all, they had many months to get their stories straight). This delegitimizes other immigrants' asylum requests. You're from North Korea? Let us vet you first, and if you're clean, welcome to America. You're from Saddam's Iraq and opposed the Ba'ath Party? Prove it and we'll welcome you to America.<br/><br/>As you can see, immigration is a significant topic in this book and thankfully presents both sides of the still-ongoing, probably never-ending issue that was reignited during Trump's presidential campaign and administration. There are two landmarks in New York that are directly related to immigration:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island">Ellis Island</a>, an island in New York Harbor that served as the first stop of new immigrants coming to America, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The Statue of Liberty is a beacon of hope for all, immigrants and citizens alike. It principally represents freedom—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to do what you like within reason—and is one of the main reasons the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/10-countries-that-take-the-most-immigrants">U.S. is the country that accepts the most immigrants year after year</a>. The poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus"><i>The New Colossus</i></a> is posted inside the Statue, and includes the lines "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." While this poem is not the law, it describes the attitude of the U.S. in the early 1900s. Many Americans are of the mind that <a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/resources-reports/reports/immigration.html">immigrants made this country what it is today</a>. So, should we adhere to our ancestor's mindsets? Or has the world changed enough that it should remain a part of history? Being the most prosperous nation in the world (see Credit Suisse's 2019 global wealth report <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2019-en.pdf">here</a> (note: it will attempt to download a PDF) , do we have an obligation to accept immigrants of other countries that are plagued by conflict, adverse living conditions, and persecution? Should we offer reprieve to those who knowingly break their country's laws, even if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">law</a> is unjust (in our opinion)?This day and review are neither the time nor place for this topic, but the book begs these questions.<br/><br/>The snakeheads' importation methods were diverse at the end, but the journey up to then was template-like. First, get the customers out of China. This was not too difficult (the place of leaving was generally Hong Kong or a corrupt SE Asian country, like Thailand), but the consequence of being caught by authorities was severe. After leaving China, the customers generally followed a path that looks like something out of Verne's <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days"><i>Around the World in 80 Days</i></a> (but including South America). For example, a one path was "Fuzhou—Hong Kong—Bangkok—Moscow—Havana—Managua—Tucson". Entry in to the U.S. was done by boat, car (Sister Ping once used a false bottom in a vehicle to transport customers over the U.S.-Mexican border undetected), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote_(person)">coyotes</a>, or even plane. How did they get onto the plane, you ask? Fake identification. While on the plane, these were promptly destroyed and followed by—you guessed it—an asylum request. Once in the U.S., it was a free-for-all. They diffused throughout the U.S. (with most going to NYC's Chinatown) and became a part of the underground economy, getting paid under the table by their employers. Official (the person, not the adjective) corruption was paramount to snakeheads, hence the inclusion of the South American countries (is a source really needed for this?), specifically Guatemala, in their path to freedom. <br/><br/>The legal perspective of snakeheads is examined in-depth: investigations into gangs and their relationship with snakeheads (gangs often acted as enforcers for the snakeheads, but eventually  began having some form of control over the snakeheads), the trial of Sister Ping, and so on. <br/><br/>Other topics discussed: Fujian culture, Chinese gangs and their terrorization of Chinatown (through acts like <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protection_money">protection money</a>), how the state of China at the time promoted the emigration of their own citizens.<br/><br/>Keefe did an excellent job with this book.

Below is the introduction section, compelling you to read this book.<br/><br/>There are reasons to read this book and <i>not</i> to read this book. First, the not-reason. From the title, <i>Human Accomplishment</i> details the successes of humans from 800 BCE to 1950—2750 years of achievement by the top-tier of <i>homo sapiens</i>. Statistically speaking, the average person will neither contribute nor perform anything absolutely significant to society. (They may contribute some relatively significant, but nothing absolute.) This book serves as a stark reminder of this fact. Some are uncomfortable with this and prefer to live thinking that they have or eventually will have a profound impact on the world, which is perfectly fine. Don't read this book nor this review. Done.<br/><br/>Now, the more compelling to-reason from another perspective. From the title, <i>Human Accomplishment</i> details the successes of humans from 800 BCE to 1950—2750 years of achievement by the top-tier of <i>homo sapiens</i>. Conveniently compiled in a single 668-page book (which includes the main body chapter, appendices, notes, bibliography, and index), Murray objectively (more on the use of this term later) lays out the crowning moments of the human race in science and the arts. No need to go through volumes of text wondering if your favorite author is considered among the best ever (hint: they're probably not). Instead, consult this book and find out who the best ever are among sciences, philosophy, art, technology, and literature.<br/><br/>Do not let Murray's reputation from his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve"><i>The Bell Curve</i></a> dissuade you from reading this book. While there are some topics that will no doubt draw criticisms from some readers (e.g., the lack of women among the significant figures), Murray defends his position both qualitatively and quantitatively and invites the reader to challenge him with a rebuttal of their own.</td></tr><tr><td>The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</td><td>James Gleick</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Lost Horizon</td><td>James Hilton</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Tartar Steppe</td><td>Dino Buzzati</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</td><td>Sebastian Junger</td><td>2</td><td>Junger's thesis is simple: Society is better when humans work and live peacefully together.

Drugs, alcohol, coffee, pornography, nothing. I haven't had the gross misfortune of being prescribed and becoming reliant on pain medication, only to have the rug pulled out from under my feeble feet, forcing me to search for alternative opiate sources, like heroin or oxycodone. I have never had to plan my day around an addiction, wondering how I'll last until lunch or closing unless I get my fix. I've never had to steal from friends or family in an effort to scrounge up enough for a 15 minutes of pleasure and reprieve from withdrawals. I do not claim to know what addiction is like, but reading from other sources (mainly the internet and friends), I have a minute fraction of an idea of how it develops and transforms a person.<br/><br/><i>Requiem for a Dream</i> is a book about addiction and what it does to people's lives. Four individuals are followed over the course of an indeterminate time period: Harry, a drug-dealing heroin addict; Tyrone, Harry's partner and fellow addict; Marion, Harry's girlfriend and fellow addict; and Sara, Harry's mother and television and diet pill addict.<br/><br/>Their lives start out addiction-free. Harry and Tyrone are semi-regular heroin users. Harry occasionally pawns  his mother's television to get enough money to score, and they both work odd jobs when needed. Marion doesn't do much work-wise. Sara eats quite a bit (bagels with cream cheese and danishes are her favorite) while watching television all day.<br/><br/>Harry and Tyrone eventually come up with the bright idea of selling heroin, referred to as "dope" in the novel. (FYI: <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dope">dope = heroin</a> in the drug world. Dope =/= marijuana, cocaine, or anything else.) Their plan was simple: sell enough (but don't get high!!) to get rich enough to do whatever they wanted. Business starts booming for them, and Harry is able to afford a new TV for his mother and new clothes for himself and everything is going accordingly to plan and Marion and Harry have these amazing plans to build an open-air coffee house where artists can drink coffee from a hundred different countries while mingling and connecting with other artists. (That's a snippet of how the book is written. Many run-on sentences, some spanning over one page.) But this honeymoon phase only lasts so long. Harry and Marion start to up their dope usage. A hit here and there, but not much more than their normal amount.  The coffee house plans sit untouched while they continue to plan their lives together: what kind of family they'll have, the car and house they'll own, how they'll live. But they can easily stop anytime they want - this stuff doesn't have that much of a grip on them.<br/><br/>Then the great shortage happens. There's no dope to be found in the city. Whispers on the street hint of a new supply coming tomorrow, the next day, next week, but the number of times those rumors are actually realized is small. This is the first time the reader realizes that Harry and Marion are addicted to dope. Selby's ability to transition the couple from average users to their current state is subtle and masterful. They start to realize their uncomfortableness when they won't or don't have a hit for the morning. Irritability and anxiety and dread soon follow. Now, I know what you're thinking, they're addicted. Well, that's where you're wrong. They can still stop anytime, but times are hard and this takes the edge off, so why stop now? (You can see the pattern of rationalizing that has been taking place.)<br/><br/>Eventually, a reputable source is able to get heroin into the city. Every junkie from miles around converges on a single part of the city, Harry and Tyrone among them. They cop (buy), book it back to their place, get off, then cut and bag the rest (short, of course) for selling. Marion questions his supply: Do you really have to sell that much?  What if there is no more? What about us? How will we get our fix?<br/><br/>Marion turns to selling herself to a heroin supplier. She does what she needs to with him without hesitation to score a few bags (without Harry knowing that she is hiding two of them), eventually getting with other women at the supplier's request to get her oh-so-precious fix. It was gross, but easy enough when considering what was on the line. Did she really want to be dopesick for hours on end, or just be uncomfortable for a half-hour?<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, Sara is busy getting addicted to diet pills, prescribed to her by her doctor. These are amphetamines. For those that have ever taken Adderall, Vyvanse, methanphetamine, etc. you realize you don't think about eating nor get hungry. She really, really wants to fit into her beautiful red dress for when she eventually makes it onto television (she's going on, there's no way she isn't, they called her and everything and they still have her card and she's just waiting for the call to tell her what show she'll be on and she'll be ready, more ready than any of the other contestants, because she's been watching every single quiz show on the tube and practicing her walk-up and smile and wave and it's perfect, but she just needs the call!!!!!!!!). The pills do their job—she's lost over 25 pounds—but at a cost. She hasn't had a proper meal in months, and they are no longer having the same effect. She goes back to the doctor's office and gets prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam">Valium</a> to calm her down. This mix of uppers and downers is potent, sending her to hospital where she is deemed schizophrenic and is treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a> at the recommendation of an impulsive doctor. She tries protesting, telling them she can't breath or eat and it hurts, but to no avail. She lives out the rest of her days in the mental hospital with no television to watch or cheese danishes to eat.<br/><br/>The book ends with Harry and Tyrone driving straight to the source in Miami. Harry's arm becomes infected while in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South">Deep South</a>  and they both get arrested for being New York dopers in their town. Harry gets his arm amputated and Tyrone is sentenced to a few months on a work crew, where he is repeatedly harassed for being black.<br/><br/>As I said, I've never been addicted to anything, nor do I plan on it (does anyone ever?). But I can say that addiction is hell for everyone. Short periods of temporary relief followed by longer periods of looking forward to the next fix leave the user in a perpetual hell, being cooled off every so often by ice water, yet still surrounded by scorching-hot flames. The pleasure of some of these drugs is a million times better than the best orgasm you've ever had, and you know how great that feels. Your brain chemistry will physically change and your body and mind and life will become dependent on the drug, subsequently changing your personality and behaviors and thoughts and the entire person you once were. You become a shell of your former self and lose family and friends to the only two-faced friend left in your life: the drug. Everything that used to give you pleasure—video games, food, theme parks—pales in comparison to this drug. Nothing will ever compare to this, and anything you do thereafter will never give you the same level of satisfaction as before.<br/><br/>If you want to hear from (presumably) real opiate users on their experiences, I encourage you to browse the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/">r/opiates subreddit</a>. Users (no pun intended) discuss their use and addiction, as applicable. You can see how addiction develops, try to understand what withdrawal symptoms feel like and why they will do almost anything to avoid them, and get a general sense of what usage is like. Another glimpse into how quickly it gets real is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/68srty/spontaneoush_uses_heroin_gets_addicted_dies_gets/">u/SpontaneousH's experience with heroin</a>.

The travel accounts are quite detailed, sometimes to the point of boring, but do an excellent job of describing the Sands and their brutality, monotony, and beauty. Rain is scarce, but an ample rainfall provides up to years of grazing for the Bedu's beloved camels (more on this later).

He found himself pining for the Sands whenever at home in England and did whatever he could to get back to his second home of Arabia. <br/><br/>Back to camels: surprisingly, unless you are already knowledegable about the Bedu, they comprise a significant portion of the book. They are the Bedu's racehorse-equivalent, although the camels aren't <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/kentucky-derby-names-best">named like horses</a>. Camels are treated with the utmost respect by their owners due to their career as a desert workhorse. Food, water, and rest are prioritized for the camels. Bedu are also similar to elephants in that they <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephants-never-forget/">never forget</a> (any camel they see). If they see a camel, it is forever burned into their memory. They also have the rather remarkable skill of being able to analyze a situation based off of a <a href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/ERM2R0/camel-tracks-in-the-red-sahara-sand-in-northern-sudan-150000-camels-ERM2R0.jpg">camel's tracks in the dry desert sand</a>.

They will bicker with each other about money, even after the transaction is months old. They will absolutely not let a guest refuse a meal - if you're with them, you're eating, no questions asked. To look greedy is to be known as the guy that eats the last piece of [your friend group's favorite food here], but ten times worse. If you accidentally kill a Bedu, say by accidentally kicking him in his solar plexus (like Thesiger did), you will die. No joke. The list goes on. Thesiger learned all of these intricacies throughout his years of living amongst the Bedu.<br/><br/>One passage spoke to me directly: "No, it is not the goal but the way there that matters, and the harder the way the more worth while the journey… I felt instinctively that it was better to fail on Everest withut oxygen than to attain the summit with its use." it seems like most modern-day adventurers use (read: require) varying amounts of assistance, whether it be through tools or personnel. For example, only 5% of Everest summits have been without oxygen. That is not to take away from those who did it with the precious gas, but it is significantly less impressive than their counterparts. Why can't things go back to being raw? If you can't bench press that weight without elbow sleeves, a bench shirt, a Gateway-Arch-esque spine, and your hands touching the plate, you shouldn't be benching that weight, just like you shouldn't be climbing Everest if you need a porter, five oxygen tanks, and all the latest and greatest REI gear (I also wrote about this in my review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3102763674"><i>Into Thin Air</i></a> (last paragraph before "Further Reading"). Mark Twight also embodies this. During his days at Gym Jones, they trained balls-to-the-wall in street clothes without worrying that their shirt wasn't of moisture-wicking technology. Anyway, rant over. Do what you want and what makes you happy.<br/><br/>An insert is included, containing pictures of bin Kabina, one of Thesiger's longest travel mates and to whom the book is dedicated, other Bedu (such as falconers), and landscape shots. Names of Bedu that Thesiger travels with can be difficult to keep track of, so "A List of the Chief Characters on the Various Journeys" is included as an appendix, organized by specific trip, e.g. "The Journey from Salala to Mughshin."<br/><br/>That's about it. If you want to learn more about Bedu culture and read a classic in the travel literature genre, then this is the book for you. If you're interested in how early maps were mapped, then this is a book for you.

Coburn finally details the legal headache that was the publishing this book and all that the Ministry of Defense did to try to stop it. A glossary and insert (pictures in the middle) are also included.<br/><br/><u>Into Action</u>:<br/><br/>During the Gulf War, a group of eight men (all SAS) were inserted deep into Iraq to hunt for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud">Scuds</a>. The mission almost instantly went wrong: their communications weren't working properly (someone gave them the wrong frequencies) and their position almost compromised by a goatherder (similar to what caused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Red_Wings#Insertion_of_SEAL_team,_compromise,_and_attack">Operation Red Wing's demise</a>). Finally, an Iraqi driving a bulldozer is what gave them away. The rest of this section details their attempted escape through a snowstorm and sharp winds, hijacking a taxi and taking a policeman hostage, and <u>almost</u> making it across the Syria-Iraq border to safety.<br/><br/><u>Call to Arms</u>:<br/><br/>Coburn discusses the path that led him to the military, specifically the New Zealand SAS, and his time spent training with various squadrons in mountains and jungles. After a while with the NZSAS, both Coburn and his friend Pete venture to Hereford to attempt to join the 22 SAS.

The quest for a unified Ireland began by the southerners being peaceful, only to come to the conclusion that, despite the popular saying, violence <i>was</i> the answer.<br/><br/><i>Say Nothing</i> uses the lives of two individuals to provide a history and story of the Troubles: Dolours Price, an IRA Volunteer ("Volunteer" is their proper name, but is akin to soldier), and Jean McConville, a mother-of-ten who was kidnapped and murdered by the IRA after being accused of being an informant to the British.<br/><br/>The book follows the Troubles in chronological order, beginning in the early 1960s (there is no definitive start date of the conflict) up to the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, which was deemed "Got Fuck All" by some.<br/><br/>Many major players in the Troubles were discussed and interviewed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams">Gerry Adams</a>, an IRA-member-turned-denier and eventual president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> political party, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Hughes">Brendan Hughes</a>, an IRA Volunteer who led their "special operations" (for lack of a better term) and organized the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Friday_(1972)">Bloody Friday</a> (which he publicly and deeply regrets), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_McIntyre">Mackers</a>, another IRA Volunteer who ended up leading the interview process of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797">Belfast Project</a>, an oral history of the Troubles told by former IRA Volunteers who now disagreed with what the movement had become.<br/> <br/>The perspectives of all are given throughout. Readers will better understand why the Troubles started in the first place, why the IRA did what they did, and why the conflict was so prolonged. <br/><br/>Despite the thoroughness of the book, Keefe did omit some aspects, e.g. loyalist terrorism. He humbly acknowledges this and directs the interested reader to "one of the many excellent books cited in the notes that address the Troubles more broadly or your favored subject in particular." Sources and notes are discussed in full and included at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that does a good job of portraying the perspectives of the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles.

With hundreds of people collaborating on a single, multi-faceted project, an astronomical amount of progress is able to be achieved. And yet, often this is done for free, without expectation of riches or fame to follow. The question that follows is obvious: Why? Why would people spend time <u>outside</u> of their paid job to code for little to no recognition nor money? Well, why do people volunteer in general? For one, they feel part of a community helping to volunteer. The same feeling applies for these OS projects. These contributors are working with people from all over the world with similar interests, helping them to improve a project for everyone else. A sense of progress is another motivator. We as humans love to see tangible progress in things we do. Productivity apps nowadays rely on the concept of "gamifying" things, i.e. showing you making progress while doing various tasks. Every accepted pull request on Github is one small (or possibly big) step of progress for that project and anything that project goes to support.<br/><br/>Anyways, off my soapbox and onto the book.<br/><br/>The book primarily focuses on the inception, development, and commercialization of the open-source operating system <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>. Originally created in 1991 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, a Finnish graduate student at the time, as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">MINIX</a>, it grew exponentially as more and more people online heard about it.<br/><br/> Other relevant open-source projects, concepts, and people are detailed and discussed, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project">GNU Project</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a>. (GPL is quite clever in that any product that uses another product that is licensed under GPL must also be licensed under GPL. The product's freeness then propagates the down the line. This concept is called copyleft.)<br/><br/>Note that this book was published in 2001, well before the advent of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, a company that hosts both public and private projects. It used a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, which was also created by Linus to help aide Linux development. While I don't keep up with software news, I suspect this book can easily be rewritten to reflect the events that have occurred in the open-source community since 2001 (20 years ago, what!).<br/><br/>If you are interested in programming as a career or hobby, I highly encourage you to join Github and see if you can help contribute to an open-source project. They are always looking for people to help, even if your experience is little to none. Find a project, fix a bug or add a feature, and submit a pull request. The worst thing that can happen is it gets rejected.<br/><br/>My rating is two stars for excitement (no offense, but how exciting can a book like this be?) and five stars for comprehensiveness and research put into this book.

Everyone reaches peak bone mass in their late 20s, but some continue to grow muscles or fat after that, cutting and bulking or maintaining that state for years on end. This growth is second to the growth of the mind. The word "learning" can easily replace the word "growing" in this paragraph's first sentence: Life is a learning process. We as both individuals and a species are constantly inventing, discovering, and refining what we do and how we do it — sometimes for ourselves and sometimes for others. Failure is a major part of growth. Failure gives feedback on actions and thoughts, allowing learning to occur. Was that the best way to go about this? Why did I think that would work? This feedback need not be applied solely to that specific action or thought, but can instead be used across a range of them: what worked in realm A can easily be applied in realm B, etc. Mark says "Truth is the source of growth," and this is spot-on. Taking an honest look at ourselves or situations gives us a clear view of what needs to be done. I'm guilty of lying to myself on many occasions to avoid the reality of the situation — this only served to make things worse later on. Do yourself a favor and be brutally honest to yourself and a-bit-less-than-brutally-honest to your companions (brutal honesty can be a bit much for some, which can cause them to use Mark's "knife" on you!) from the get-go. Those companions that appreciate the honesty are definitely worth keeping.<br/><br/><a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight"><i>Twitching with Twight</i></a>, arguably Mark's most famous essay (it's included in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill"><i>Kiss or Kill</i></a>), is a prime example of seizing control of life, cutting off the excess fat and distractions, and focusing on the goals and desires one truly wants. A key part of this is the "cutting" - often times certain objects (gear), people (significant others or friends), or mindsets (fear of failure, lack of belief of capability) hold us back from achieving our true potential. Cliche, yes, but true nonetheless. Mark discusses the "knife", referring to his ability to "cut off everything that might have held [him] back." While some view this cutting as detrimental, it can actually be quite beneficial. Take the friend who is a leech on your wellbeing or the mindset that you will never be able to climb that route or lift that much weight. Cut that friend out of your life and believe in your ability to achieve that feat - these cuts will greatly improve your life, assuming you do your part of putting in the work to achieve these goals. Mark says it best at the end of "Unlock" piece: "It [control] can start anywhere — we need only realize that the lock is within, and the key within reach. ... We learn that by taking control of ourselves we reduce the power others have over us. ... the goal of [fitness] is autonomy. It is Self-determination." (While I'm sure those that read this book are aware of Mark's background, he created the reputed <a href="https://gymjones.com/">Gym Jones</a>, hence the fitness references found throughout the book.) Unsurprisingly, Mark is a fan of Ayn Rand, referencing her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead?from_search=true&qid=ysdj3ExhFT&rank=1"><i>The Fountainhead</i></a> and acknowledging her influence in his own <i>Kiss or Kill</i>.<br/><br/>Part of this "taking control" is standing strong against the norm — one must find their own way among the vast sea of disinformation and what is considered "right" and "good". (Howard Roark, <i>The Fountainhead</i>'s protagonist, is a great example of this.) In high school, I kept my interests hidden from my friends, as it was different from what others thought a normal teenager should be doing. In hindsight, this was *somewhat* wrong. While being proud of some interested would have gotten me made fun of, others likely would not have. I now unashamedly promote most of my interests, only hiding the ones that deviate significantly from the norm. "We need more individuals, of unique opinion and voice and strength."<br/><br/>Taking and accepting risks is an important part of the human experience. They can be frightening, exhilarating, and/or wildly rewarding, depending on the venture. It is especially rewarding when that risk pays off and you grow as a person. Not much more needs to be said on this. Analyze the possible outcomes and those outcomes' outcomes and all of their respective probabilities, then make the choice to push ahead and stay back. Just make sure you won't regret it later.<br/><br/>Now, a bit about the book itself. The book is simply a series of short (1-3 page) essays. The writing can be a bit cryptic at times, as you'll know if you've read <i>Kiss or Kill</i>. This turned me off at times, but is helpful in provoking thought about what Twight meant and why he expressed it that way. It is full of images that have accompanying text: some photographs (portraits, action shots, nature-related), some renderings (not sure if that's the right word, but it's the best I have), some paintings (?).

(Objective meaning the value of stolen goods is accurate. Stolen artwork's value is difficult to quantify.) While the heist itself comprises most of the book, the authors discuss culture and industry information as needed.<br/><br/>The book is organized in rough chronological order. It begins with a detailed history of the Italian city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin">Turin</a>, where all of the thieves involved in the heist hail from. The chapter is titled <i>School of Turin</i>, referencing the not-insignificant amount of career criminals that the city produces (schools may be a better verb here). The authors describe the history and culture of the city, and how Notarbartolo, the mastermind behind the heist, fits in to the city.<br/><br/>The history and current standing of the diamond industry is provided throughout the book: culture, conflict (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond">blood diamonds</a>), and standard operating procedures, among other aspects. Readers will also learn how the giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Legal_issues">De Beers unashamedly has (had?) a monopoly</a> on the diamond industry. (Consider getting your significant other a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/3e8w8q/moissanite_vs_diamond/">moissanite stone</a> or lab-grown diamond. Significantly less expensive and conflict-free!)<br/><br/>A majority of the book details the planning, preparation, and execution of the heist. Notarbartolo spent over two years casing the building and its security before they executed. These two years were not spent waiting for the right moment - Notarbartolo was constantly taking notes and gaining information crucial to the heist (type of vault door, patterns of security, etc). He made regular trips back to Italy to consult with his partners and share his recent learnings.<br/><br/>These two long years culminated on the evening of 15 February 2003. The team was able to infiltrate the building using a homemade garage door opener (with 2^8 = 1024 possible frequencies, it is easy to iterate through the combinations to find the correct one to open the door). They proceeded to the vault, where they were able to bypass/disable three alarms/sensors: motion, sound, and a magnet inside the vault door. Once inside, the rest was easy. Using a specialized tool, the thieves were easily able to pry open a majority of the rather flimsy safety deposit boxes belonging to a variety of companies and individuals. The loot was varied: gemstones, watches, currency, securities/bonds, and personal effects. There was so much to steal that they had to leave a fair amount behind. Using a getaway car, they retreated to Notarbartolo's apartment to sift through their treasure, throwing out comparatively-worthless emeralds.<br/><br/>The following morning, each member left separately (some in groups of two) to head back to Italy while the crime was being discovered only a small distance away. One member was tasked with disposing of the trash, which included some compromising materials. He chose what turned out to be one of the unluckiest spots in all of Belgium: a forest owned by a nothing-better-to-do-than-patrol-his-land-for-litterers man. (Not to say littering is acceptable, but dumping garbage in forests is common in Belgium and not many seem to care (according to the authors).) This was the downfall of the team. The detectives were immediately dispatched to the rural plot of land and were able to begin piecing together who was behind this expensive crime. <br/><br/>After dividing their haul accordingly in the safety of Italy, Notarbartolo returned to Antwerp to tie up loose ends, unaware that he was the most-wanted man in the country. He was promptly detained along with his wife and friends, marking the beginning of his multi-year confinement (consisting of detainment and actual imprisonment). The authors briefly describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Belgium">Belgian legal system</a> and prisons in this section.<br/><br/>While in prison, Notarbartolo attempted to sell the rights to <i>his</i> story (emphasis discussed in next sentence) to multiple sources. "His" is highlighted because it varies wildly from both what the authors write here and what is probable/believable. The authors refute his account in the last section.<br/><br/>The authors preface the book by describing their research method. Throughout the book, they are careful to denote hazy, non-established points, e.g. no one knows why the thieves did this, but here's why we think they did it, etc. Notes are detailed and well-documented for further reading or referencing.<br/><br/>I see a few things wrong with the team's operation. First is the poor disposal of the garbage. To put everything together is sheer idiocy. Throwing it away in an unknown location doubles up on the foolishness. Too much of their heist was left up to blind luck (that was decreased to an extent): avoiding building guards or police, not knowing about a hidden sensor, and so on. They had over two years to prepare for the simple garbage disposal, yet failed in the worst possible way. Second is Notarbartolo's failure to place goods in his safety deposit box then proceed to rob himself (his box wasn't even opened!). He claimed that he took everything out beforehand, but even then that is suspicious. Instead, he should have placed a significant amount of material in there and simply pried open his, too. Third is their lack of Italian extradition laws. While these eventually changed under pressure from other European nations, resulting in the imprisonment of other members of the team, they would have all been safe for quite a long time had they just stayed in Italy. I suspect it would have also been more difficult to gather a case against them. Fourth, they should not have taken specifically-dated surveillance tapes, but rather all of them. This shifts focus off of those specific days and obscures the suspect list. Their disposal of the tapes was also subpar: they simply pulled them apart. Investigators were able to reconstruct them, furthering the evidence they had against the team. Surprisingly fundamental mistakes by a team intelligent enough to plan and execute a heist of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book. It reads similar to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)"><i>Ocean's</i></a> film, except it actually happened.<br/><br/>Further reading/watching:<br/>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)"><i>Ocean's</i></a> series.

However, being published in 1997, there had only been a few multi-death events.)<br/><br/>The book provides a list of people and their affiliations, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of who's who, and a map of the route taken from Everest base camp to the summit.<br/><br/>Krakauer provides a history of Everest throughout the book, from the initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary">Hillary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay">Tenzing</a> ascent to modern-day climbs, as well as the progression of the climbing itself and culture behind it. People often think climbing Everest is a simple task: go to Nepal/Tibet (there's a Tibet route), acclimate to the altitude, rent some O2 tanks, then get yourself up to the top. In reality, it is an extremely expensive ($11,000 permit just to be allowed to climb from the Nepal side) and time-consuming (two months is about average summit time) adventure. Teams will hire base camp managers just to coordinate resources for getting up the mountain.

Krakauer provides everyone's movements and survivor's experiences. Krakauer is one of the first to get back to Camp Four safely, unaware of the other climbers experiencing the storm higher up on the mountain.<br/><br/>Krakauer reflects on the decisions both he and others made while up on the mountain. However, the brain behaves significantly differently when hypoxic (almost impossible to avoid at Everest-level altitudes) and under extreme fatigue (both from lack of sleep and physical exertion).<br/><br/>The last 50-ish pages account the evacuation of the injured off the mountain and Krakauer's personal dealings with what happened.<br/><br/>A postscript is provided to refute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Boukreev">Anatoli Boukreev</a>'s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/925367.The_Climb?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=7KSpx3LmL3&rank=1"><i>The Climb</i></a> and the criticisms of <i>Into Thin Air</i>. Boukreev was a lead guide for another expedition who descended from the summit long before many of his expedition's clients made it up. A quote from the book describing Boukreev's guide philosophy: "... strongly held opinions about how the mountain should be ascended. He was quite outspoken in his belief that it was a mistake for guides to pamper their clients. 'If client cannot climb Everest without big help from guide, this client should not be on Everest.

The research that goes into some of them is easily five-star-quality, but the topic is so dull (to me!) that my enjoyment is a mere one- or two-star. Using this type of two-quality rating system, <i>Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success</i> deserves a solid three stars: five for research, thoroughness, and analysis, and one for my personal satisfaction.<br/><br/>Lisa Endlich, a former GS VP and trader, lays out the complete history of Goldman Sachs during its privately-owned days (inception up to May 1999, when the company went public). Chapters are separated by years, some short (Chapter 4 is 1990-1991) and some long (Chapter 2 is 1869-1976).<br/><br/>In discussing the history, the expansion into foreign/emerging markets and new geographical places is focused on. There was often debate between GS becoming a jack of all trades and master of none, or focusing on a select few business divisions and becoming the best in those. In the end, they essentially decided both. Without expanding into new businesses, the firm would not be able to expand as they wanted to.<br/><br/>Partnership is one of the common themes you will see throughout the book. To become a partner means you've made it, plain and simple. It is an exclusive, prestigious club that only a select few get the privilege of becoming a part of. Partners were inducted every X years (I forgot exactly, may be X = 1) after a lengthy, intense, and argumentative session about who should be chosen and who should be left behind. Some left the firm after being told this wasn't their year, feeling betrayed after giving their working life to the firm.<br/><br/>The subtitle, <i>The Culture of Success</i>, is also a common theme. At GS, you must be a contributor (why is this not a policy everywhere?), else you will see the door very quickly. GS attempted to recruit the smartest, hardest-working people, especially those who would put the firm at the top of their priorities. Through this selection process, the firm's culture of success and competitiveness was created.<br/><br/>While I'm sure the media contributes to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/11/goldman-sachs-doj-settlement/>modern-day image of GS</a> (sorry for paywall, but the headline is enough to make the point</a> and bankers in general, none of its misdeeds are discussed in the book, not that it was expected. A few quotes (I can't find them in the book, so take my word) struck me as funny after a GS event (see below) a few years ago: they stress the idea that customers are first and foremost in ensuring the successfulness of GS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS9r1Dk-Zg8&feature=youtu.be&t=45">GS took a position against the product they were selling to customers</a>, yet Blankfein continues to defend his firm's actions... How!<br/><br/>The later chapters are devoted to the discussion of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/other-information/ipo-prospectus-gs-pdf-file.pdf">GS's famous IPO</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Corzine">Jon Corzine</a>, former trader and then-CEO, was instrumental in convincing the partnership of selling the company to the public. This decision was made over the course of many, many years, roundtables, and hours of analysis and thinking. The IPO did not come fast enough from their final "yes", though. The market soon tumbled, and what was going to make some of the top partners $100MM+ richer soon went down into a measly (ha!) 8-figure range.<br/><br/>Some amount of financial literacy and understanding of how markets operate would help, but is not necessary.<br/><br/>For similar books, see <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254826/index.htm">Fortune's <i>The Smartest [Business] Books We Know</i></a>.

Food is allowed to be purchased, guards take bribes willingly (not sure about this one in the U.S.), and if you escape and make it out of Turkey, they will likely not pursue you, with the unspoken agreement that you will never step foot onto Turkish soil again. In the case of the prison Hayes spent most of his time in, children were in an adjacent facility, allowing them to play ball together during recesses.<br/><br/>Smuggling was commonplace throughout the prisons. Hashish (wait, what?), drugs, and other items were smuggled in by various means, such as outside workers, and sold to inmates. Billy received money hidden in books sent to him.<br/><br/>The frustration of the bureaucratic process of Hayes' case is embedded in the text. He constantly writes to a U.S. official at the embassy for assistance, but doesn't hear back for weeks at a time, only to find out the case has moved nowhere. Turkish lawyers give Hayes hope of early release after charging him hundreds or thousand of lira, then claim they haven't been able to make progress or what they said earlier didn't hold. On the bright side, Hayes' sentence was commuted several times: originally sentenced to four years, the charge was changed to smuggling from possession resulting in a standard length of life. After being bumped down to 30 years, he was granted amnesty and the sentence again commuted. Finally, good behavior knocks off a third of your final sentence length. This left Hayes with a grand total of about seven years in prison.<br/><br/>After trying multiple avenues of both legal and illegal escape (using U.S. clout, getting transferred to an insane asylum, attempting to use a file to cut the bars on his window), he settled on escaping from an island prison. Hayes swam out to anchored fishing boats, stole a small dingy, then rowed to shore, where he poorly disguised himself and was able to make his way to Greece. He was captured by Greek forces, interrogated (nicely) for a few weeks, then finally deported back to the U.S.<br/><br/>Hayes also discusses his emotional state throughout his imprisonment in regards to his parents (specifically his father), his lover (Lillian), and friendships (and sexual relations) with fellow inmates. "The emotional coldness of prison life was worth than the physical cold. Loneliness is an aching pain." Massive guilt is felt about his crime and how it has affected his parents, especially after his father's warnings about dropping out of university and going to travel the world would get him into "trouble". His father was significantly impacted financially due to lawyer fees and travel costs (later helped by the book's advance money). His lover, Lillian, was extremely supportive during his imprisonment and played a significant role in making it easier on him. Some friendships were formed, one of which turned into a sexual one through a basic need for human touch and love.<br/><br/>I think Hayes did a good job of describing both what prison life is like on the body, mind, and soul. My one takeaway (that was already well ingrained in me): don't go to prison!<br/><br/>Some further videos to watch: Wes Watson, a former <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shot%20caller">shot caller</a> in a California state prison gang, discusses his experiences in prison and why you never, ever want to go there. While the stories can't be completely corroborated, they are not unreasonable to believe. This should further viewers' desires not to end up in prison one day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUxLYGeeIKxxioUqL54Q8g">Channel here</a>.

There is also sufficient coverage of his life before the ambassadorship and after his forced resignation.<br/><br/>Dodd, a professor of American history at University of Chicago focusing on the American South, was recommended to Roosevelt by an old friend. Having completed his PhD studies at Leipzig University in German, he was already familiar with the culture and language and could hit the ground running when he arrived. He hesitantly accepted and brought his family: wife, Mattie, daughter, Martha, and son, Bill Jr.<br/><br/>The book focuses mostly on Dodd, but a good portion is also spent on Martha and her various love affairs and doings in Berlin. Martha starts out as a Nazi sympathizer, claiming they are simply proud of their country and wanting the best for it after the disastrous WWI. She is courted by multiple Nazis, including Gestapo chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diels">Rudolf Diels</a>, and a Russian secretly working for the NKVD (Russian secret police). Her support for the Nazi party gradually wanes as she experiences more violence and discontent among German citizens.<br/><br/>Multiple people (called the Pretty Good Club (this is the only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pretty-good-club-founding-fathers/dp/0393056589">book</a> I can find on them)) in the State Department were not fans of Dodd due to his lack of prestigious upbringing (read: lack of Ivy League education) and wealth. Due to the Great Depression happening in the U.S., Dodd insisted that he should live within his modest $17500 salary. This included driving his rather outdated Chevrolet or even walking to work. These seemingly innocent actions infuriated PGC, as it insulted and tainted the prestige of the ambassador position. I must agree with Dodd's position here, even if it is a bit extreme. He cites other U.S. officials and their relatively small families living in massive homes with opulent decor and numerous servants, all of which is unnecessary (a subjective word, but likely to be generally agreed upon). Passive aggressive letters were sent by the PGC in response to Dodd's, and other letters Dodd sent that were explicitly said to be confidential were leaked to the press to stir disfavor.<br/><br/>The naivety of Dodd and other U.S. officials surprised me. While hindsight is 20/20, the gross transgressions against U.S. citizens in Germany and the gradual restriction of Jewish rights/privileges should have been dealt with more severely. Several times the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">SA</a> attacked U.S. citizens for minor (although major for them) issues, like not saluting while a parade was going on. Nazi officials placated Dodd and others by promising these members would be brought to justice and that this type of behavior was an abnormality.<br/><br/>Major events leading up to the peak of Nazi Germany are discussed: purges (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives">Night of the Long Knives</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_in_Nazi_Germany#Laws">controversial laws</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#Dictatorship">changes in the governmental structure</a> (the most significant, in my opinion, was the death of German president Hindenburg and Hitler's immediate consolidation of the position of president and chancellor, which effectively gave him complete control of the government), and events that affected the U.S.-Germany relationship (1934 Mock Trial of Hitler), among many others.<br/><br/>In the Sources and Acknowledgment sections, Larson discusses his sources and which ones were more valuable for his "particular parcel of ground", rather than just general histories of Nazi Germany or WWII. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34442928-ambassador-dodd-s-diary?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nkLomb0q1e&rank=1"><i>Ambassador Dodd's Diary</i></a> (no reviews??) and Martha's memoir, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11726930-through-embassy-eyes?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kazTAuW6hp&rank=1"><i>Through Embassy Eyes</i></a>, were particularly helpful in getting a glimpse into both of their thought processes and obtaining direct quotes. University libraries (Yale, Harvard, Columbia) and public resources were also used. Larson explains his careful cross-examination of sources to verify information. This section is greatly appreciated - it gives credibility to the information and the further reading can be especially guiding to those interested in this topic/time period. A standard list of sources is included after the source discussion.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that provides a unique perspective that I, and likely many others, never considered.

Their realizing that NK is not what the regime says is gradual. It begins with noticing the electricity is intermittent: sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. Then it progresses to lack of food and salary. (Their assigned jobs normally gave them paychecks and foodstamp-equivalents to pay for basic items and get their three daily meal.) Salaries dwindled down to nothing and foodstamps provided three, then two, then a measly one meal per day (and even that one meal regressed in size). Propaganda offset the frustration by encouraging one meal a day to help their country and blaming capitalism for preventing food deliveries. Black markets thrived, with authorities turning a blind eye, as they were also hungry.<br/><br/>Hunger was a large focus of the book. To make up for lack of food and lack of money to purchase food, people got creative (as we normally do when faced with a life-or-death situation). They traveled far into the countryside to raid orchards. They peeled bark off of trees, ground it into a coarse powder, then boiled it into soup, along with freshly-picked grass from the side of the road. They picked from the excrement of animals to salvage undigested food. Some opened up illegal gardens in their backyards. Roaming gangs of children, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotjebi">kotjebi</a>, would rush markets, knocking over the stall and its vendor and grabbing as much food as possible. Children were admitted to hospitals due to intense stomach aches caused by inedible items used as food that their immature stomachs couldn't process. Prostitution was common, with payment being in form of food.<br/><br/>Another focus was propaganda and the "brainwashing" (should that really be in quotes?) of the citizens. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim il-Sung</a> (the original leader of North Korea) died in 1994 and caused a week of lamentation across the entire country. People never considered the fact that their "Great Leader" (how they refer to him) could actually die. This caused huge concern about the future: if Kim il-Sung could die, anything could happen. Children were taught songs, one of which's had a phrase that included the title of the book. (I find this quite ironic, as it can take on two meanings. They are completely satisfied and have nothing they envy of others, or they have nothing that others would envy of them. The latter seems much more applicable.) To maintain the stature of the leader, insults or derogatory remarks about them resulted in hard labor camps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_North_Korea"> more on NK prisons here</a>) and even executions (which were performed regularly). Everyone was encouraged to spy on their neighbors for any signs of lack of allegiance.<br/><br/>One side note on NK giving up their nuclear weapons (briefly discussed in the book). I attended a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Lord">Winston Lord</a>, who is currently on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Human_Rights_in_North_Korea">U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a>. During the Q&A portion, someone asked his thoughts about the NK nuclear situation. He was firm in his response: NK will never give up their nuclear weapons. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi">Qaddafi</a> gave up his WMDs, we left him high and dry. NK apparently (I haven't been able to find a source - please reply to this if you can find one!) released an official statement saying something along the lines of "we now know what happens when a country gives up their WMDs". While I hope denuclearization does happen, I must agree with Lord. NK's WMDs and the supposed hundreds of missiles pointing at SK are the only things stopping the regime from being removed.</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesdays with Morrie</td><td>Mitch Albom</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</td><td>Christopher McDougall</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Catch-22 (Catch-22, #1)</td><td>Joseph Heller</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Amber Spyglass  (His Dark Materials, #3)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Son (The Giver Quartet, #4)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gossamer</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Soldiers Of Reason: The RAND Corporation And The Rise Of The American Empire</td><td>Alex Abella</td><td>3</td><td>Soldiers of Reason details the history of RAND, from its inception to modern times (well, 2008, when the book was published). Abella discusses and details both the important periods of time/events RAND was involved in (Cold War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, Iraq War, Watergate, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.), as well as the notable people involved (Henry Kissinger, Paul Wolfowitz and others) and the role they played in guiding both the organization itself and the government (exclusively the U.S., up until the 2000's) it served.<br/><br/>RAND, standing for Research ANd Development, was established to assist the U.S. Air Force in various research capacities. It attracted a wide-range of academics, from physicists to social scientists and everyone in between. Nuclear war was the primary focus in the early stages of RAND, where the researchers asked questions about preemptive strikes, strategic locations of munitions and vehicles, and the status of the Soviet's nuclear program. Game theory was researched by John Von Neumann (arguably the greatest polymath of all-time) and others to be applied to the Soviet threat.<br/><br/>During the Vietnam War, RAND analysts participated by interviewing North Vietnamese prisoners-of-war to learn about their motivation. After finding out that the Vietcong "described themselves as patriots leading a war of national liberation", the analysts realized the war would be a lot more difficult than initially anticipated. However, it was not their place to decide what was right or wrong, difficult or easy: their job was to synthesize the data and report it. Like America at the time, a large rift was created between RAND employees: pro-war and anti-war. Daniel Ellsberg, part of the anti-war faction, was the RAND employee who leaked what is known as the Pentagon Papers, documents detailing the truth on what the U.S. government was really doing in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In addition to international assignments, RAND also accepted commissions concerning domestic matters, such as one from New York City's mayor John Lindsay to study reformation of the city's unpopular government. Other federal entities, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have also sought RAND's abilities in improving their methods.<br/><br/>The book's last few chapters discuss terrorism and RAND's role in working with and assisting the U.S. government in combating it.<br/><br/>RAND is still alive and well today (rand.org). Their website details all of their research areas and divisions, the reports they publish, the experts they employ, and their abilities. They even have a graduate school for public policy.<br/><br/>Despite being mostly in the shadows, RAND has and will continue to play a large (the importance is subjective) role in shaping and guiding U.S. policy for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Overall, a run-of-the-mill nonfiction book detailing the history of a company. Definitely boring at times, but interesting at others.</td></tr><tr><td>Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon</td><td>Kim Zetter</td><td>5</td><td>A thoroughly-researched book that examines the both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"> Stuxnet virus</a> and cyberwarfare policy individually, as well as their crossroads as it relates to the modern era.<br/><br/>Zetter's descriptions and explanations of all things technical is phenomenal. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_centrifuge">uranium-enriching centrifuges</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">zero-day computer exploits</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA">SCADA</a>, they are simplified enough for the layperson to understand without sacrificing information. Little to no technical background is required to understand the technology discussed, although it certainly doesn't hurt. <br/><br/>The book details the investigation (and obsession) of Stuxnet by a select number of security researchers and firms spread across the world. Zetter describes the researchers' process into dissecting the incredibly complex <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2010-071400-3123-99">Stuxnet code</a> (I suggest reading through this link, as Symantec was one of those "select number of security researchers and firms") and how they were finally able to understand its final payload.<br/><br/>U.S. cybersecurity and cyberwarfare policy, general cyber "philosophy" (for lack of a better term), and the legality of cyber operations are also discussed. Should zero-day exploits be able to be sold to the highest bidder, whether that be a nation-state or terror group? Do zero-day researchers have an obligation to disclose said exploit to the respective software? How should we respond to zero-day offensives aimed at the U.S? (Hint: depending on the severity of the attack, it may be considered an act of war, and you don't want to be on the wrong side of America when that happens.) Zetter describes what the U.S.' current policy is towards these questions and what discussions are taking place, albeit behind closed doors. <br/><br/>Even if you don't care about the Stuxnet virus or its impact, the cyber aspect of the book is extremely important to understand in this day and age. Our lives are becoming evermore electronically interconnected (phones connect to computers to cars to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-refrigerator-4158327">refrigerators</a> (wait, what?) to watches), and with it comes vulnerabilities. While those are small-scale connections, compromising large-scale systems has the potential to kill individuals and ravage society: economic markets, power grids, transportation networks, healthcare systems, and computing centers. While there is little ordinary citizens can do to help prevent this, it helps to be informed on issues like this.</td></tr><tr><td>Number the Stars</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Tale of Despereaux</td><td>Kate DiCamillo</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The City of Ember (Book of Ember, #1)</td><td>Jeanne DuPrau</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</td><td>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</td><td>5</td><td>Review summary: An enjoyable (can I say that with what this book is about?) read about a horrific historical time period. Solzhenitsyn, with the translation help of Willetts, does a good job of describing the human condition in the face of evil and how it was managed over many years.<br/><br/>The book accounts details the fictional Ivan Denisovich's (Shukhov, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Slavic_naming_customs">Slavic naming conventions</a> can help here, and in other Russian novels) experiences in one of Stalin's forced labor camps. Forced to confess he was a German spy, this account was taken during around his seventh year in prison.<br/><br/>Despite the horrible conditions they faced, there was plenty of time for happiness to be felt in the form of tobacco, warmth, and Sundays off (quite similar to what non-prisoners enjoy!). As the final paragraph begins: "Shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep. A lot of good things had happened that day." An important lesson can be learned from this: despite harrowing conditions, happiness can still be felt in the form of hope (e.g. your prison sentence ending) or temporary relief (e.g. a cigarette). <br/><br/>The treatment of the prisoners was better than what I was expecting, although I'm not sure how much was censored by the USSR. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956?ac=1&from_search=true">Gulag Archipelago</a>, also by Solzhenitsyn, is supposedly more brutal and uncensored than <i>One Day</i>, which, not coincidentally, he was not allowed to publish in the USSR.<br/><br/>While I'm not a Russian speaker, Willetts seemed to do an adequate job of translating the humor and messages (after all, it's the only authorized version of this book).<br/><br/><i>One Day</i> and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> are two important books about a terrible time in world history. OD is a bit more accessible (shorter, less descriptive), while TGA is out of reach/interest for many readers (~2000 pages across three volumes, vivid imagery = darker). I will tackle TGA at some point and compare with this.<br/><br/>For historical background, Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">Gulag</a> article is well-researched, descriptive, and comprehensive if you are looking to learn more about this time period.</td></tr><tr><td>Being Peace (Being Peace, #1)</td><td>Thich Nhat Hanh</td><td>2</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Sound and the Fury</td><td>William Faulkner</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Brave New World</td><td>Aldous Huxley</td><td>4</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10</td><td>Marcus Luttrell</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Godfather</td><td>Mario Puzo</td><td>5</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Radioactivity: A History of a Mysterious Science</td><td>Marjorie C.

In the helicopter ride-along he learns about the ideal city layout for policing, and other small bits of knowledge about "bulgar theory" and policing methods.<br/><br/>A good portion of the book consists of anecdotes to complement his learnings and give some practical (although some of them are not so practical!) examples of real-life burglaries. He discusses tunneling into bank vaults (<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/thieves-use-sewage-pipes-tunnels-to-break-into-bank-vault-full-of-jewels-in-antwerps-diamond-district"> yes, this does happen</a>) and using social engineering to fool companies into sending you master key cards.<br/><br/>Manaugh briefly discusses the legal theory behind burglary. What is considered a building? When and where are you considered to be "inside" of a building? Some states take into account intent, meaning if you have suspicious items on you, despite a perfectly good explanation for each, you can still be charged with a crime.<br/><br/>An important topic discussed towards the book's end is that of "<a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2010/01/nakatomi-space/">Nakatomi Space</a>", named after the plaza in the movie Die Hard, where the protagonist travels around a skyscraper uses everything <u>but</u> conventional methods. The independent research Gwern discusses Nakatomi Space and some of its applications in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c0nqg7/people_seem_to_think_thieves_should_lockpick_or/er6huvz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app">this Reddit comment</a>.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway from this book is using objects in manners they are <u>not</u> meant to be used in, e.g. enter a room through the thin drywall rather than the reinforced steel door with three deadbolts and a booby trap. It is through this outside-of-the-box thinking that the most successful burglars have gotten away with crimes.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</td><td>Alexandra David-Néel</td><td>5</td><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet provides an excellent summary of Tibetan practices, beliefs, and culture in the beginning of the 20th century. If anyone has a suggestion for a more modern book detailing similar information, I'd love to hear it.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_David-N%C3%A9el">Alexandra David-Néel</a> is a French linguist and Buddhist who has spent significant time traveling in and around Tibet.<br/><br/>The book is split up into eight chapters: Tibet and the Lamas, A Guest of the Lamas, A Famous Tibetan Monastery, Dealing with Ghosts and Demons, Disciples of Yore and Their Contemporary Emulators, Psychic Sports, Mystic Theories and Spiritual Training, and Psychic Phenomena in Tibet - How Tibetans Explain Them.<br/><br/>Each chapter is a mix of her travels in Tibet and Tibetan practices as they relate to the chapter's title. She gives detailed background information about the practices: how they began, what Tibetans believe about them, and how the practices are actually performed. Take, for example,  <i> lung-gom </i>, a type of training that is said to "develop uncommon nimbleness and especially enables its adepts to take extraordinarily long tramps with amazing rapidity". David-Néel describes her interactions with <i> lung-gom-pas </i>, first encountering one in Chang thang of Northern Tibet, then another who was wearing iron chains to prevent himself from floating off into space (since the training supposedly makes you lighter than air). She then describes the training itself: jumping cross-legged from the bottom of a pit and crawling through a minuscule hole from a cell they've been in for seven days. Throughout these descriptions, she explains the Tibetans' reasoning and thoughts behind why and how these work. Complementary anecdotes and folklore are also shared throughout the book. This process is used for the most of the Tibetan practices and culture she describes.<br/><br/>There is a lot of mysticism and spiritual belief that David-Néel does a good (and respectful) job of not diminishing, but rather objectively explains their perspective. The book ends in a request for scientists to "undertake serious investigations of the phenomena [which David-Néel experienced]", as some of the events she describes are seemingly unexplainable. Considering this was written in the 1930s, I am curious to see how much, if any, Tibetan beliefs have changed in regard to these subjects since then.<br/><br/>There is little concept of time throughout (no "in 19XX I did this"), but she does mention this book is the culmination of over 10 years of research and studying.<br/><br/>Pictures are mostly of persons, but also include some places.</td></tr><tr><td>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society</td><td>Dave Grossman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger (The Giver, #3)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>I Am the Messenger</td><td>Markus Zusak</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Notebook of Leonardo Da Vinci</td><td>Leonardo da Vinci</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Extraordinary Voyages, #6)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Mysterious Island (Extraordinary Voyages, #12)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Pearl</td><td>John Steinbeck</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again</td><td>J.R.R.

<table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Author</th><th>My Rating</th><th>My Review</th></tr><tr><td>Flowers for Algernon</td><td>Daniel Keyes</td><td>4</td><td>A deeply moving story about a mentally retarded adult's journey from retardation to genius and back, complete with experiences of love, realization, learning, self-reflection, success, and failure. The writing is masterful—Keyes is able to gradually display Charlie's ever-increasing intelligence just through writing. He begins learning punctuation, remembers the correct spelling of words, and makes connections with the real world.<br/><br/>I especially liked the adherence to the hypothesis: "artificially-induced intelligence deteriorates at a rate of time directly proportional to the quantity of the increase". In laymen terms, if you gain a significant amount of intelligence from the surgery, expect to lose it quickly when you start to lose it. Charlie is sadly proven correct: while his initial intelligence gain was slow, his decline was quick, taking a short two months, from mid-September to mid-November, peak to original standing.</td></tr><tr><td>The Outsiders</td><td>S.E. Hinton</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Class: A Guide Through the American Status System</td><td>Paul Fussell</td><td>1</td><td>I wasn't alive in 1982, so I don't have much say as to how relevant it was then (almost 40 years ago!), but it is largely, if not entirely, irrelevant now. Fussell illustrates the various U.S. class systems primarily through examples, looking at anatomy, appearances, homes, consumption and recreation, mental state and tendencies, and speech. The last two chapters discuss the difficulty in changing classes, especially the improvement part.<br/><br/>If you are to take two things from this book, the first is that class is largely signaling. People want to appear healthier, wealthier, more well-read, etc., than their neighbors and friends. Stop trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses">keep up with the Joneses</a> and live your life. The second is that people of different classes view the so-called requirement to join each class as different. Upper class, while having money, views their class as one based on behaviors. The source of the money is also a factor: those that inherited their bank accounts' nine digits are considered a higher class than those that earned it through business ventures. Middle class believes in both education and money. Low class believes almost entirely in money. Fussell gives an example of two people that make the same amount of money: one is a white-collar worker, the other blue-collar. Their differences lie in their interests and behaviors.

His youngest, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r">Judit</a>, is considered the best female chess player of all-time.<br/><br/>Polgar's method for raising a genius is relatively straightforward and devised from the upbringings of other so-called geniuses (Polgar researched many childhoods in preparation for his own children's). Start young, specialize in a specific topic, and continue studying and refining specialization. After reading this, most people would have an image of an abusive father disciplining his children for only studying chess openings for 6 hours that day, not 7—but Polgar is quite the opposite: he focused on ensuring his children's happiness alongside their success, not just the latter. The children <i>want</i> to play and learn chess for both themselves and their father, and do not feel forced or pressured into doing so. He balances failures and successes in a 1:10 ratio, allowing the children to experience what it's like to fail while still gaining self-confidence through successes. They should be praised often for their work, not to inflate their ego, but to make them feel worthy as a competitor and peer, not just a child.<br/><br/>Starting young is due to Polgar's belief (he cites the 1) WHO's Barnet (can't find source) saying that "the first five years of life are most important in forming a person’s behavior," and 2) B. Bluhm's book <i>Consistency and Change in the Human Personality</i> (I couldn't find this at all on Google even trying multiple spellings of "Bluhm", please contact me if you are able to), which says that "50% of a person’s intellect is formed during the first four years of life, and a child’s extraordinary ability to understand, typical until four years of age, little by little decreases with the passage of time") that after childhood, the brain's ability to learn new skills drastically diminishes, e.g., learning a foreign language is much more difficult for adults than young children. To take advantage of this time, Polgar started his children at the ripe age of 3. He begins with basic instruction in foreign languages (his top choice was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a> for its simplicity and cultural significance, but the girls also speak Russian) and moves on to basic games to pique the child's interest. Serious training begins around the age of 6 and continues from there.<br/><br/>Polgar chose his children's specialization as chess, but also proposes mathematics, physics, music, and foreign languages. This decision needs to be made at a young age (3-4), so as not to waste any of their precious enhanced-development time.<br/><br/>In continuing their chess specialization, Polgar had them playing chess 5-6 hours per day from the age of 4-5. One clarification on the word "playing" in the previous sentence: while "playing" is grammatically correct and it is not referred to as "training" or "working" chess, it was still "play" in the true sense of the noun: the girls were having fun while continuing to develop their abilities to high levels. This perception of play is crucial to the development of a genius, as it prevents burnout and boredom from occurring. A typical day for his children consists of "4 hours of specialist study, 1 hour of a foreign language, 1 hour of a general study (native language, natural science and social studies), 1 hour of computing, 1 hour of moral, psychological, and pedagogical studies (humor lessons as well), [and] 1 hour of gymnastics". A full day! But going back to the use of "playing", these days are enjoyable. The girls enjoy learning new chess openings, or how to converse in Esperanto, or a new joke.<br/><br/>While this specialization is exclusive to one field, hence the term "specialization", it does make the acquisition of other skills easier through the use of learning heuristics. It's often said the the knowledge learned in university may not be directly applicable to a career, but the problem-solving skills learned will be. Polgar states the same thing. By achieving a high level in one field and "learn[ing] how to learn", picking up new skills will be easier.<br/><br/>Polgar often claims that he himself can raise anybody to be a genius given full reign of their environment, especially the social aspect: "Genius is not born, genius is raised." The nature crowd from the nature vs. nurture debate will have a pretty big issue with this. He cites Watson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson#%22Twelve_infants%22">twelve infants</a>" quote, in which the famous psychologist boasts he can raise any one of them into a "specialist...regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors."<br/><br/>Even if Polgar's claims about the guarantee of raising a genius using similar methods, the child raised will still be an outstanding citizen. Polgar preaches morality as the foundation of genius, and views it as a major factor in the development of genius. He describes his qualities of a moral genius as follows: "I see before me a person who is sacrificial, honest, and courageous; a good friend and family member, not cynical, not egotistical, but empathetic and good-hearted, who feels responsibility, is attentive, and is capable of keeping secrets, who does not misuse their power, does not gossip, and can master their ambition, who is just, demands quality, an internationalist and not envious, who generally behaves in a friendly way and does not judge others easily, who is persistent, has initiative, conscious of duty, critical, self-critical and conscientious, who relates well to learning or ignorance, and who is capable of self-education (self-perfection), who has self-control, who is sincere and strives for freedom for themself and others, whose ethics are at a similarly high level, who is modest, able to love others, who has solidarity, tolerance and politeness, has a healthy competitiveness, is helpful, peaceful, and well-intentioned, who shows respect to those who merit it, etc. This kind of person is definitely an exemplary moral authority. Whoever has in themselves all of the qualities above to a high level is a moral genius, even if they never become a hero, and even if those around them never consider them to be one." Try to find an undesirable quality in the above description—it's impossible.<br/><br/>Polgar does not shy away from criticisms of his system (there are many, including from the Hungarian government itself), but answers them thoughfully and completely. Hungary originally tried to suppress the Polgar sisters' successes, but thankfully did not succeed. He is especially critical of modern educational systems in regards to learning, stating the children see no obvious purpose in learning. In his system, they see tangible progress and become more motivated, creating a perpetual cycle of learning. I must agree with him here. Are "international and cultural diversity" credits (as my university referred to them) truly necessary? What is the purpose of making them a mandatory part of a degree program? To make sure I'm a well-rounded citizen of society? Who's to say I'm not already? Anything worth learning should have a purpose to it, else it seems fruitless and motivations wanes. He also sees educational systems as catering to the lowest common denominator, preventing potential geniuses from succeeding and fulfilling said potential. This was one of the principal reasons he chose to self-teach his girls.<br/><br/>The book is organized in a question-answer fashion, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endre_Farkas">Endre Farkas</a> acting as the interviewer.<br/><br/>While I am no parent, it seems reasonable enough to suggest that most people should read this book. Outside of the genius education part, Polgar makes a compelling case on ways to raise a child to be well-rounded in ethics, morals, intelligence, work ethic, and any other venture they attempt.</td></tr><tr><td>The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America</td><td>Erik Larson</td><td>2</td><td><i>The Devil in the White City</i> consists of two stories that overlap slightly: the life and murders committed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes">Dr. H.

O'Hanlon begins with the basics of gases (their properties, flow regimes, relation with solids) and progresses to actual vacuum concepts. The mathematics behind vacuum are included with explanations, as well as lay-person descriptions. While the descriptions are nice, I encourage the reader to search the internet for videos of how the various pumps operate, as it is much clearer than words and a static figure.<br/><br/>Third edition should be purchased if possible—the second edition was published before the invention of some important technology, e.g., scroll pumps.</td></tr><tr><td>The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir</td><td>Philip J.

Each of his six years has one chapter devoted to it: projects worked on, individuals met, mindset (happy, burnt out, frustrated, etc), and vision for the future. The epilogue includes 20 lessons Guo learned and serves as a good, high-level summary of his graduate studies.<br/><br/>Academia has a lot of intricacies that generally aren't understood and can't be learned by outsiders—in order to understand, one has to be a part of a research group.

Is it laziness that causes this? Does the task-doer just want most of the job to be done for him, so he can move on to more interesting (at least to him) things? This is absolutely part of it. What about selfishness and fairness? Does the task-doer want the task-master to take some amount of ownership in the task, since he seems to be doing nothing other than ordering his inferiors around? This is a plausible explanation, but one likely taken by the ignorant (although in some cases this absolutely can be true): the task-master likely has higher-level tasks needing to be done, and delegation is a great tool for improving efficiency. The last cause can be attributed to ignorance. The task-doer simply doesn't know that he can find the answers to his questions independently, leading him to ask his questions. This should be explained and forgiven only once: show him how to find answers, and for any questions asked for future tasks, precede the answers with a simple counter-questions: have you tried searching for it?<br/><br/>There are controversial views present (especially in the age of mega-corporations and their inhumane treatment of their serva...employees), but they are mostly reflected at small businesses with direct relationships between the head honcho and the employees. Regardless, some quotes: (1) "My heart goes out to the man who does his work when the “boss” is away, as well as when he is at home." (2) "I know one man of really brilliant parts who has not the ability to manage a business of his own, and yet who is absolutely worthless to any one else, because he carries with him constantly the insane suspicion that his employer is oppressing, or intending to oppress, him." Oh, how Hubbard would be surprised. (3) "I think if I worked for a man, I would work for him. I would not work for him a part of his time, but all of his time. I would give an undivided service or none."<br/><br/>The message is still relevant, but some parts dated and no longer applicable to life now.

This claim is not an opinion, nor can it be argued, questioned, or debated—it just is, and only those who have read this masterpiece will be able to comprehend this fact.<br/><br/>Tolstoy explores a plethora (but not to excess) of themes through the perspective of five aristocratic Russian families and their relations during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>: Bolkónsky, Rostov, Bezúkhov, Kurágin, and Drubetskóy. And despite being written 150 years ago, these motifs still directly apply to 21st-century life. Past generations are often looked at differently than the current generation—the current gen'ers think their parents can't and don't and won't possibly understand what is going on, can't <i>possibly</i> put themselves in their position, can't feel what they are feeling—but how they are mistaken. Some experiences transcend the time period, the social status, the location that people think make them unique and unlike anybody else. Tolstoy recognizes this fact of life while looking back from the 1860s onto the 1800-1820s, masterfully discussing the bravery required during times of war; the passion one feels towards a lover both in and out of their presence; financial stress and its toll on mental and physical health; the concept of love, not just of a spouse, but of comrades, family members, and humanity in general; the difference between free will and consciousness and their role in contributing to history; teenage infatuation and mistaking it for love and allowing it to engulf your thoughts and body and actions and life and being, only to eventually to realize it's not what it was nor will it ever be that; the concept of being good and doing good for their intrinsic value, not for some underlying purpose; the desire for glory and fame amongst one's peers and countrymen and family and the fine line between courage and sheer recklessness in the attempt to achieve it; the sense of identity one feels with their nation and their people and their desire to contribute to and support that identity through the participation of war; the need for revenge after one has been wronged and the forgiveness that some choose to give towards the offender; the love of God and all His doings; the feeling of needing to take action, even when the event that the action is acting upon is already in motion and the action one proposes will serve little to no purpose except making them feel and look better; the facade of strength one puts on to ward off an enemy, despite being crippled internally; the concession of valuables in exchange for a later, but more valuable result; the standing up against adversity for what one knows and believes is the right action, regardless of the difficulty of the decision; the momentum one feels from victories, the dejection one feels from losses, and the contribution each has on the psyche and performance of an individual in future ventures. These are only some of the themes within this beautiful work and are much more elegantly expressed and developed within the pages.<br/><br/>The final part (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-h/2600-h.htm#link2H_4_0370">Epilogue: Part Two</a> (note that this is not the Pevear-Vorohonsky translation, but the gist is understood)) is the most significant of all of the volumes and parts and worth reading in and of itself. Tolstoy discusses power, free will, causes, and their roles in shaping and driving history forward. After examining the former two, he asks and promptly answers the "two essential questions of history: (1) What is power? and (2) What force produces the movement of peoples?" In regards to power, "power is that relation of a certain person to other persons in which the person takes the less part in the action the more he expresses opinions, suppositions, and justifications for the jointly accomplished action." Tolstoy uses the standard military model to exemplify power—the commander-in-chief takes the least part of action and the most of expressing his opinion (giving orders), the generals have a bit more action and less opinion, and so on and so forth all the way down to the infantry, where they perform all the action and have little to no opinion in the grand scheme of things. In regards to the force, "the movement of peoples is produced, not by power, not by intellectual activity, not even by a combination of the two,...but by the activity of <i>all</i> the people taking part in the event and always joining together in such a way that those who take the greatest direct part in the event, take the least responsibility upon themselves, and vice versa." This definition is a bit opaque, allowing it to serve as a segue into the second part of Part Two: free will. Do humans truly have free will? is a question that has plagued philosophers since the beginning. We believe in and trust the natural laws that govern physical objects, e.g., gravity, but refuse to accept that man's will may be governed by a set of natural laws that, despite not being seen nor understood, act upon us as <a href="https://www.history.com/news/did-an-apple-really-fall-on-isaac-newtons-head">gravity does an apple</a>. Tolstoy distinguishes between consciousness (our ability to lift our arm when told to) and free will (the ability to direct our paths in life): consciousness is completely within reach of the individual, while free will is out of reach and dictated by history.<br/><br/>What causes history to occur? Is it the leaders of men, like Napoleon or Alexander I? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">great man theory</a> states that "history can be largely explained by the impact of great men". Tolstoy rejects this notion, instead proposing that no event has a single cause, but rather a multitude of smaller causes. While some view event X as the cause of of event Z, others may have a different perspective and see event Y as the cause of event Z. Does this mean one of them is wrong? Possibly. But one cause may not be mutually exclusive with another. One can go down the line of causes, finding a chain reaction that never ends. This is Tolstoy's grievance with (some) historians: they attempt to ascribe a single cause to the happening of something, not taking into account the many factors that contribute. When these factors align by coincidence is when great events occurs. For example, take a 20-digit combination lock, where the unlocking is a great event and the individual numbers are causes in the form of events. It takes all twenty numbers to align for the lock to open, but none of the individual numbers were the deciding factor in the event happening.<br/><br/>Tolstoy does not consider <i>War and Peace</i> a novel, nor an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry">epic</a>, nor a historical chronicle, nor really fit for any set genre of literature. Instead, it's in its own category altogether, mixing and refining a variety of literary genres to create the 1200+ page (translation-dependent) work.<br/><br/>Translations are a tricky and often controversial subject. Some readers swear by one translator, while others condemn that translator for their lack of accuracy and inability to convey the subtleties that author originally meant to express in the native version of the work. Pevear is a low-level Russian speaker and native English speaker and Volokhonsky is a native Russian speaker and high-level English speaker. (I can't find any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">CEFR results</a> from either Pevear or Volokhonsky, but based on interviews I've watched, she has a strong grasp of English and he has been said to be <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/07/the-translation-wars">non-conversational</a> in Russian, implying some proficiency.) Together they have a comprehensive, close-to-foolproof method of translating. Volokhonsky goes through the novel's Russian version and translates it directly to English, along with notes about the author's intricate meanings and verbiage within the text: What did Tolstoy really mean by that? How does Dostoevsky's use of this specific phrase contribute to the atmosphere of the passage? Pevear then cleans up her direct translation into more fluid English. Volokhonsky checks his new-and-improved translation and they continue to refine it until the English version matches the Russian version in all details, such as tone, meaning, etc. This exchange of accuracy and nuance continues a few more times in either direction, until they are satisfied. Pevear then reads the newly-translated English version to Volokhonsky while she simultaneously reads the original Russian. This method is advantageous for two obvious reasons. First, there are native speakers of both languages checking the original and checking the translation, producing two checkpoints in which errors can be detected. The native part is crucial. Other translators, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Garnett">Garnett</a>, learned the from-language later in life (Garnett began learning Russian at the ripe age of 30), which many believe to be less efficient and effective than learning them as a child. (This has been refuted by some, but by-and-large remains true: I nor anyone in my close friend group know anyone who has learned another language past the age of 20 to the fluency required to make an accurate translation. And yet, most bilingual speakers learned their languages at a young age.) Garnett's late-learning shows in her criticisms by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GwfplQ3OK8EC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=nabokov+on+garnett+dry+and+flat&source=bl&ots=m7gEg1cnEk&sig=ACfU3U27zRicnxvo_yS8WSNSmfpuhjcM7w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid_rnrnpDpAhVJ-6wKHX8HA_sQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nabokov%20on%20garnett%20dry%20and%20flat&f=false">Nabokov</a>. Second, and an extension of the first, there are more checkpoints for errors to be detected. No first draft is ever perfect (Tolstoy is reported to have written seven drafts for <i>War and Peace</i>!), and both errors and improvements can be found when making multiple passes. With all this being said and while I suggest Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation, I encourage you to do your research on translations and choose the one you think is best.<br/><br/>Russian novels, and this book in particular, are infamous for giving readers trouble when it comes to names. After a few hundred pages, the many relations are clear, but it definitely helps to have a loose sheet at the ready. If the book includes the list, bookmark that for quick reference.<br/><br/>The length is no doubt daunting, but the story is engrossing enough that the number of pages becomes irrelevant. All you begin to care about is what happens next, not that you have 800 pages left. I personally tend to get bored after around 400-500 pages—get to the point! Not with <i>War and Peace</i>. The length allows Tolstoy's thoughts to develop at their own pace—they're not hurried because the book is getting too long.<br/><br/>This book should be and needs to be read by all, whether interested in literature or not. The themes are timeless, the writing superb, and the story riveting.</td></tr><tr><td>Death of a Salesman</td><td>Arthur  Miller</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Hound of the Baskervilles</td><td>Arthur Conan Doyle</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>A Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes, #1)</td><td>Arthur Conan Doyle</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Much Ado About Nothing</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Crucible</td><td>Arthur  Miller</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Macbeth</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Romeo and Juliet</td><td>William Shakespeare</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Silent World</td><td>Jacques-Yves Cousteau</td><td>3</td><td>If news broke today that an eighth continent had been found, tens of thousands would flock to their nearest airport for a chance to experience this unexplored territory.

Trafficking is the illegal transportation of an uncooperative person from location A to location B and generally involves sex and/or slavery, among other things. All of the people in this book were smuggled into the U.S. willingly and without coercion.<br/><br/>The book revolves around two things: The most famous of snakeheads, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Ping">Cheng Chui Ping</a> (image <a href="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590951662179605b11ad2fe2/1:1/w_290,h_290,c_limit/sister-ping.jpg">here</a>, more commonly known by her moniker Sister Ping and the incident of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Venture"><i>Golden Venture</i></a>.<br/><br/>Born in Fujian, China (where a majority of snakeheads are from), Sister Ping immigrated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan">New York City's Chinatown</a> to run a shop, while also smuggling as her side hustle with her husband. She charged over $30,000 USD for a single person to be smuggled. Being from Fujian in that time generally meant that you were poor, an agreement was made: pay a small down payment, then pay the remaining balance after you got into the U.S. The remaining balance was paid through underground labor, e.g. dishwashing. Sister Ping's reputation was impeccable. She got people in safely and with money-back guarantee. As time progressed, other snakeheads got into the game, hopeful of the riches that came with the business. Snakeheads worked together to board people onto a common ship, making a single run cheaper than it would have been individually. Some even feigned association with Sister Ping to make their business seem more credible to prospective customers.<br/><br/>The Golden Venture was a cargo ship that intentionally ran aground outside of New York City. Almost 300 illegal aliens were on board and jumped ship in their attempt to make it to the promised land that was the U.S. Those that did not drown (10) or were not caught (not sure the number here) were taken to various prisons throughout the U.S. to await sentencing. It was here that they applied for asylum. Here is where it gets tricky. Snakeheads had taught their customers how to essentially guarantee their asylum request was granted. Just say you were persecuted in China and/or that you feared for your life, and bam! you can stay. This is problematic for obvious reasons. How are these claims meant to be verified? Lawyers and law enforcement have a few methods to check the aliens' veracity: Repeat what they said back to them, but change a small detail (if they confirm your sentence, then it contradicts what they just said). Ask them about something they said a few days ago and see if the story changes. Cross-examine other witnesses or official accounts. Even then, the possibility remains that some are just excellent liars or just really stuck to their script (after all, they had many months to get their stories straight). This delegitimizes other immigrants' asylum requests. You're from North Korea? Let us vet you first, and if you're clean, welcome to America. You're from Saddam's Iraq and opposed the Ba'ath Party? Prove it and we'll welcome you to America.<br/><br/>As you can see, immigration is a significant topic in this book and thankfully presents both sides of the still-ongoing, probably never-ending issue that was reignited during Trump's presidential campaign and administration. There are two landmarks in New York that are directly related to immigration:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island">Ellis Island</a>, an island in New York Harbor that served as the first stop of new immigrants coming to America, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The Statue of Liberty is a beacon of hope for all, immigrants and citizens alike. It principally represents freedom—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to do what you like within reason—and is one of the main reasons the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/10-countries-that-take-the-most-immigrants">U.S. is the country that accepts the most immigrants year after year</a>. The poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus"><i>The New Colossus</i></a> is posted inside the Statue, and includes the lines "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." While this poem is not the law, it describes the attitude of the U.S. in the early 1900s. Many Americans are of the mind that <a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/resources-reports/reports/immigration.html">immigrants made this country what it is today</a>. So, should we adhere to our ancestor's mindsets? Or has the world changed enough that it should remain a part of history? Being the most prosperous nation in the world (see Credit Suisse's 2019 global wealth report <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-report-2019-en.pdf">here</a> (note: it will attempt to download a PDF) , do we have an obligation to accept immigrants of other countries that are plagued by conflict, adverse living conditions, and persecution? Should we offer reprieve to those who knowingly break their country's laws, even if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">law</a> is unjust (in our opinion)?This day and review are neither the time nor place for this topic, but the book begs these questions.<br/><br/>The snakeheads' importation methods were diverse at the end, but the journey up to then was template-like. First, get the customers out of China. This was not too difficult (the place of leaving was generally Hong Kong or a corrupt SE Asian country, like Thailand), but the consequence of being caught by authorities was severe. After leaving China, the customers generally followed a path that looks like something out of Verne's <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days"><i>Around the World in 80 Days</i></a> (but including South America). For example, a one path was "Fuzhou—Hong Kong—Bangkok—Moscow—Havana—Managua—Tucson". Entry in to the U.S. was done by boat, car (Sister Ping once used a false bottom in a vehicle to transport customers over the U.S.-Mexican border undetected), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote_(person)">coyotes</a>, or even plane. How did they get onto the plane, you ask? Fake identification. While on the plane, these were promptly destroyed and followed by—you guessed it—an asylum request. Once in the U.S., it was a free-for-all. They diffused throughout the U.S. (with most going to NYC's Chinatown) and became a part of the underground economy, getting paid under the table by their employers. Official (the person, not the adjective) corruption was paramount to snakeheads, hence the inclusion of the South American countries (is a source really needed for this?), specifically Guatemala, in their path to freedom. <br/><br/>The legal perspective of snakeheads is examined in-depth: investigations into gangs and their relationship with snakeheads (gangs often acted as enforcers for the snakeheads, but eventually  began having some form of control over the snakeheads), the trial of Sister Ping, and so on. <br/><br/>Other topics discussed: Fujian culture, Chinese gangs and their terrorization of Chinatown (through acts like <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protection_money">protection money</a>), how the state of China at the time promoted the emigration of their own citizens.<br/><br/>Keefe did an excellent job with this book.

Below is the introduction section, compelling you to read this book.<br/><br/>There are reasons to read this book and <i>not</i> to read this book. First, the not-reason. From the title, <i>Human Accomplishment</i> details the successes of humans from 800 BCE to 1950—2750 years of achievement by the top-tier of <i>homo sapiens</i>. Statistically speaking, the average person will neither contribute nor perform anything absolutely significant to society. (They may contribute some relatively significant, but nothing absolute.) This book serves as a stark reminder of this fact. Some are uncomfortable with this and prefer to live thinking that they have or eventually will have a profound impact on the world, which is perfectly fine. Don't read this book nor this review. Done.<br/><br/>Now, the more compelling to-reason from another perspective. From the title, <i>Human Accomplishment</i> details the successes of humans from 800 BCE to 1950—2750 years of achievement by the top-tier of <i>homo sapiens</i>. Conveniently compiled in a single 668-page book (which includes the main body chapter, appendices, notes, bibliography, and index), Murray objectively (more on the use of this term later) lays out the crowning moments of the human race in science and the arts. No need to go through volumes of text wondering if your favorite author is considered among the best ever (hint: they're probably not). Instead, consult this book and find out who the best ever are among sciences, philosophy, art, technology, and literature.<br/><br/>Do not let Murray's reputation from his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve"><i>The Bell Curve</i></a> dissuade you from reading this book. While there are some topics that will no doubt draw criticisms from some readers (e.g., the lack of women among the significant figures), Murray defends his position both qualitatively and quantitatively and invites the reader to challenge him with a rebuttal of their own.</td></tr><tr><td>The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</td><td>James Gleick</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Lost Horizon</td><td>James Hilton</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Tartar Steppe</td><td>Dino Buzzati</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging</td><td>Sebastian Junger</td><td>2</td><td>Junger's thesis is simple: Society is better when humans work and live peacefully together.

Drugs, alcohol, coffee, pornography, nothing. I haven't had the gross misfortune of being prescribed and becoming reliant on pain medication, only to have the rug pulled out from under my feeble feet, forcing me to search for alternative opiate sources, like heroin or oxycodone. I have never had to plan my day around an addiction, wondering how I'll last until lunch or closing unless I get my fix. I've never had to steal from friends or family in an effort to scrounge up enough for a 15 minutes of pleasure and reprieve from withdrawals. I do not claim to know what addiction is like, but reading from other sources (mainly the internet and friends), I have a minute fraction of an idea of how it develops and transforms a person.<br/><br/><i>Requiem for a Dream</i> is a book about addiction and what it does to people's lives. Four individuals are followed over the course of an indeterminate time period: Harry, a drug-dealing heroin addict; Tyrone, Harry's partner and fellow addict; Marion, Harry's girlfriend and fellow addict; and Sara, Harry's mother and television and diet pill addict.<br/><br/>Their lives start out addiction-free. Harry and Tyrone are semi-regular heroin users. Harry occasionally pawns  his mother's television to get enough money to score, and they both work odd jobs when needed. Marion doesn't do much work-wise. Sara eats quite a bit (bagels with cream cheese and danishes are her favorite) while watching television all day.<br/><br/>Harry and Tyrone eventually come up with the bright idea of selling heroin, referred to as "dope" in the novel. (FYI: <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dope">dope = heroin</a> in the drug world. Dope =/= marijuana, cocaine, or anything else.) Their plan was simple: sell enough (but don't get high!!) to get rich enough to do whatever they wanted. Business starts booming for them, and Harry is able to afford a new TV for his mother and new clothes for himself and everything is going accordingly to plan and Marion and Harry have these amazing plans to build an open-air coffee house where artists can drink coffee from a hundred different countries while mingling and connecting with other artists. (That's a snippet of how the book is written. Many run-on sentences, some spanning over one page.) But this honeymoon phase only lasts so long. Harry and Marion start to up their dope usage. A hit here and there, but not much more than their normal amount.  The coffee house plans sit untouched while they continue to plan their lives together: what kind of family they'll have, the car and house they'll own, how they'll live. But they can easily stop anytime they want - this stuff doesn't have that much of a grip on them.<br/><br/>Then the great shortage happens. There's no dope to be found in the city. Whispers on the street hint of a new supply coming tomorrow, the next day, next week, but the number of times those rumors are actually realized is small. This is the first time the reader realizes that Harry and Marion are addicted to dope. Selby's ability to transition the couple from average users to their current state is subtle and masterful. They start to realize their uncomfortableness when they won't or don't have a hit for the morning. Irritability and anxiety and dread soon follow. Now, I know what you're thinking, they're addicted. Well, that's where you're wrong. They can still stop anytime, but times are hard and this takes the edge off, so why stop now? (You can see the pattern of rationalizing that has been taking place.)<br/><br/>Eventually, a reputable source is able to get heroin into the city. Every junkie from miles around converges on a single part of the city, Harry and Tyrone among them. They cop (buy), book it back to their place, get off, then cut and bag the rest (short, of course) for selling. Marion questions his supply: Do you really have to sell that much?  What if there is no more? What about us? How will we get our fix?<br/><br/>Marion turns to selling herself to a heroin supplier. She does what she needs to with him without hesitation to score a few bags (without Harry knowing that she is hiding two of them), eventually getting with other women at the supplier's request to get her oh-so-precious fix. It was gross, but easy enough when considering what was on the line. Did she really want to be dopesick for hours on end, or just be uncomfortable for a half-hour?<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, Sara is busy getting addicted to diet pills, prescribed to her by her doctor. These are amphetamines. For those that have ever taken Adderall, Vyvanse, methanphetamine, etc. you realize you don't think about eating nor get hungry. She really, really wants to fit into her beautiful red dress for when she eventually makes it onto television (she's going on, there's no way she isn't, they called her and everything and they still have her card and she's just waiting for the call to tell her what show she'll be on and she'll be ready, more ready than any of the other contestants, because she's been watching every single quiz show on the tube and practicing her walk-up and smile and wave and it's perfect, but she just needs the call!!!!!!!!). The pills do their job—she's lost over 25 pounds—but at a cost. She hasn't had a proper meal in months, and they are no longer having the same effect. She goes back to the doctor's office and gets prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam">Valium</a> to calm her down. This mix of uppers and downers is potent, sending her to hospital where she is deemed schizophrenic and is treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a> at the recommendation of an impulsive doctor. She tries protesting, telling them she can't breath or eat and it hurts, but to no avail. She lives out the rest of her days in the mental hospital with no television to watch or cheese danishes to eat.<br/><br/>The book ends with Harry and Tyrone driving straight to the source in Miami. Harry's arm becomes infected while in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South">Deep South</a>  and they both get arrested for being New York dopers in their town. Harry gets his arm amputated and Tyrone is sentenced to a few months on a work crew, where he is repeatedly harassed for being black.<br/><br/>As I said, I've never been addicted to anything, nor do I plan on it (does anyone ever?). But I can say that addiction is hell for everyone. Short periods of temporary relief followed by longer periods of looking forward to the next fix leave the user in a perpetual hell, being cooled off every so often by ice water, yet still surrounded by scorching-hot flames. The pleasure of some of these drugs is a million times better than the best orgasm you've ever had, and you know how great that feels. Your brain chemistry will physically change and your body and mind and life will become dependent on the drug, subsequently changing your personality and behaviors and thoughts and the entire person you once were. You become a shell of your former self and lose family and friends to the only two-faced friend left in your life: the drug. Everything that used to give you pleasure—video games, food, theme parks—pales in comparison to this drug. Nothing will ever compare to this, and anything you do thereafter will never give you the same level of satisfaction as before.<br/><br/>If you want to hear from (presumably) real opiate users on their experiences, I encourage you to browse the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/">r/opiates subreddit</a>. Users (no pun intended) discuss their use and addiction, as applicable. You can see how addiction develops, try to understand what withdrawal symptoms feel like and why they will do almost anything to avoid them, and get a general sense of what usage is like. Another glimpse into how quickly it gets real is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/68srty/spontaneoush_uses_heroin_gets_addicted_dies_gets/">u/SpontaneousH's experience with heroin</a>.

No, I am not a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/le-wrong-generation">le wrong generation kid</a> complaining about <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/2018-soundcloud-rappers-guide.html">Soundcloud rappers</a>. I'm complaining about the lack of uncharted territory in the world. Reading Thesiger's account of his exploration of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali">Empty Quarter</a>. He is truly venturing into the unknown, without knowledge of what lies in that vast, arid, uninhabitable (the Bedu would beg to differ) region. There are <a href="https://www.insider.com/unexplored-places-around-the-world-2019-12#surtsey-a-volcanic-island-off-of-iceland-has-only-ever-been-open-to-researchers-3">very few places</a> left on Earth that are unexplored, namely islands and other hard-to-access places. I can only imagine the wonder and excitement Thesiger felt as he traveled in places no human had before.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this book was published in 1959, before the globalization and modernization of Arabia and the essential extinction of traditional Bedu culture.<br/><br/>The book switches off between two topics: Thesiger's travel accounts and discussion of Arab, specifically Bedu, culture. The travel accounts are quite detailed, sometimes to the point of boring, but do an excellent job of describing the Sands and their brutality, monotony, and beauty. Rain is scarce, but an ample rainfall provides up to years of grazing for the Bedu's beloved camels (more on this later). The dunes stretch <a href="https://www.wildfrontierstravel.com/media/cache/responsive/hero-1920/upload/6f/11/6f1135106019f2b03374ae86a0a8c8d0b5383964.jpeg?413f26a0">on and on and on and on for miles</a> and <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BMikbnHP7oQeYVE4ZKc9B716MtCTSZLzroQ9hTnGnCKO8ziCDuij6EIr-wV6WCF0LEUN1aUg7vPuOHSDhxEzkjz57cbyy8Fi--9dp92NO4oYtqd6KsQ">rise up hundreds of feet</a>, preventing even the most durable of camels from summiting. And yet Thesiger could not keep away. He found himself pining for the Sands whenever at home in England and did whatever he could to get back to his second home of Arabia. <br/><br/>Back to camels: surprisingly, unless you are already knowledegable about the Bedu, they comprise a significant portion of the book. They are the Bedu's racehorse-equivalent, although the camels aren't <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/kentucky-derby-names-best">named like horses</a>. Camels are treated with the utmost respect by their owners due to their career as a desert workhorse. Food, water, and rest are prioritized for the camels. Bedu are also similar to elephants in that they <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephants-never-forget/">never forget</a> (any camel they see). If they see a camel, it is forever burned into their memory. They also have the rather remarkable skill of being able to analyze a situation based off of a <a href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/ERM2R0/camel-tracks-in-the-red-sahara-sand-in-northern-sudan-150000-camels-ERM2R0.jpg">camel's tracks in the dry desert sand</a>.

They will bicker with each other about money, even after the transaction is months old. They will absolutely not let a guest refuse a meal - if you're with them, you're eating, no questions asked. To look greedy is to be known as the guy that eats the last piece of [your friend group's favorite food here], but ten times worse. If you accidentally kill a Bedu, say by accidentally kicking him in his solar plexus (like Thesiger did), you will die. No joke. The list goes on. Thesiger learned all of these intricacies throughout his years of living amongst the Bedu.<br/><br/>One passage spoke to me directly: "No, it is not the goal but the way there that matters, and the harder the way the more worth while the journey… I felt instinctively that it was better to fail on Everest withut oxygen than to attain the summit with its use." it seems like most modern-day adventurers use (read: require) varying amounts of assistance, whether it be through tools or personnel. For example, only 5% of Everest summits have been without oxygen. That is not to take away from those who did it with the precious gas, but it is significantly less impressive than their counterparts. Why can't things go back to being raw? If you can't bench press that weight without elbow sleeves, a bench shirt, a Gateway-Arch-esque spine, and your hands touching the plate, you shouldn't be benching that weight, just like you shouldn't be climbing Everest if you need a porter, five oxygen tanks, and all the latest and greatest REI gear (I also wrote about this in my review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3102763674"><i>Into Thin Air</i></a> (last paragraph before "Further Reading"). Mark Twight also embodies this. During his days at Gym Jones, they trained balls-to-the-wall in street clothes without worrying that their shirt wasn't of moisture-wicking technology. Anyway, rant over. Do what you want and what makes you happy.<br/><br/>An insert is included, containing pictures of bin Kabina, one of Thesiger's longest travel mates and to whom the book is dedicated, other Bedu (such as falconers), and landscape shots. Names of Bedu that Thesiger travels with can be difficult to keep track of, so "A List of the Chief Characters on the Various Journeys" is included as an appendix, organized by specific trip, e.g. "The Journey from Salala to Mughshin."<br/><br/>That's about it. If you want to learn more about Bedu culture and read a classic in the travel literature genre, then this is the book for you. If you're interested in how early maps were mapped, then this is a book for you. If you're wanting to go on an adventure in a barren wasteland with the occasional oasis and need an estimate on how much it will suck, this is a book for you._x000B_<br/>My three stars is the average of my enjoyment (2) and thoroughness of the book (4).<br/><br/>Further materials:<br/>	- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDWNFueckoM"> The Empty Quarter documentary (1967)</a>.<br/>	- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5934152-the-silent-world">The Silent World</a>.

After a while with the NZSAS, both Coburn and his friend Pete venture to Hereford to attempt to join the 22 SAS.

The quest for a unified Ireland began by the southerners being peaceful, only to come to the conclusion that, despite the popular saying, violence <i>was</i> the answer.<br/><br/><i>Say Nothing</i> uses the lives of two individuals to provide a history and story of the Troubles: Dolours Price, an IRA Volunteer ("Volunteer" is their proper name, but is akin to soldier), and Jean McConville, a mother-of-ten who was kidnapped and murdered by the IRA after being accused of being an informant to the British.<br/><br/>The book follows the Troubles in chronological order, beginning in the early 1960s (there is no definitive start date of the conflict) up to the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, which was deemed "Got Fuck All" by some.<br/><br/>Many major players in the Troubles were discussed and interviewed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams">Gerry Adams</a>, an IRA-member-turned-denier and eventual president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> political party, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Hughes">Brendan Hughes</a>, an IRA Volunteer who led their "special operations" (for lack of a better term) and organized the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Friday_(1972)">Bloody Friday</a> (which he publicly and deeply regrets), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_McIntyre">Mackers</a>, another IRA Volunteer who ended up leading the interview process of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797">Belfast Project</a>, an oral history of the Troubles told by former IRA Volunteers who now disagreed with what the movement had become.<br/> <br/>The perspectives of all are given throughout. Readers will better understand why the Troubles started in the first place, why the IRA did what they did, and why the conflict was so prolonged. <br/><br/>Despite the thoroughness of the book, Keefe did omit some aspects, e.g. loyalist terrorism. He humbly acknowledges this and directs the interested reader to "one of the many excellent books cited in the notes that address the Troubles more broadly or your favored subject in particular." Sources and notes are discussed in full and included at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that does a good job of portraying the perspectives of the Republic of Ireland during the Troubles.

With hundreds of people collaborating on a single, multi-faceted project, an astronomical amount of progress is able to be achieved. And yet, often this is done for free, without expectation of riches or fame to follow. The question that follows is obvious: Why? Why would people spend time <u>outside</u> of their paid job to code for little to no recognition nor money? Well, why do people volunteer in general? For one, they feel part of a community helping to volunteer. The same feeling applies for these OS projects. These contributors are working with people from all over the world with similar interests, helping them to improve a project for everyone else. A sense of progress is another motivator. We as humans love to see tangible progress in things we do. Productivity apps nowadays rely on the concept of "gamifying" things, i.e. showing you making progress while doing various tasks. Every accepted pull request on Github is one small (or possibly big) step of progress for that project and anything that project goes to support.<br/><br/>Anyways, off my soapbox and onto the book.<br/><br/>The book primarily focuses on the inception, development, and commercialization of the open-source operating system <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>. Originally created in 1991 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, a Finnish graduate student at the time, as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">MINIX</a>, it grew exponentially as more and more people online heard about it.<br/><br/> Other relevant open-source projects, concepts, and people are detailed and discussed, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project">GNU Project</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a>. (GPL is quite clever in that any product that uses another product that is licensed under GPL must also be licensed under GPL. The product's freeness then propagates the down the line. This concept is called copyleft.)<br/><br/>Note that this book was published in 2001, well before the advent of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, a company that hosts both public and private projects. It used a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, which was also created by Linus to help aide Linux development. While I don't keep up with software news, I suspect this book can easily be rewritten to reflect the events that have occurred in the open-source community since 2001 (20 years ago, what!).<br/><br/>If you are interested in programming as a career or hobby, I highly encourage you to join Github and see if you can help contribute to an open-source project. They are always looking for people to help, even if your experience is little to none. Find a project, fix a bug or add a feature, and submit a pull request. The worst thing that can happen is it gets rejected.<br/><br/>My rating is two stars for excitement (no offense, but how exciting can a book like this be?) and five stars for comprehensiveness and research put into this book.

Everyone reaches peak bone mass in their late 20s, but some continue to grow muscles or fat after that, cutting and bulking or maintaining that state for years on end. This growth is second to the growth of the mind. The word "learning" can easily replace the word "growing" in this paragraph's first sentence: Life is a learning process. We as both individuals and a species are constantly inventing, discovering, and refining what we do and how we do it — sometimes for ourselves and sometimes for others. Failure is a major part of growth. Failure gives feedback on actions and thoughts, allowing learning to occur. Was that the best way to go about this? Why did I think that would work? This feedback need not be applied solely to that specific action or thought, but can instead be used across a range of them: what worked in realm A can easily be applied in realm B, etc. Mark says "Truth is the source of growth," and this is spot-on. Taking an honest look at ourselves or situations gives us a clear view of what needs to be done. I'm guilty of lying to myself on many occasions to avoid the reality of the situation — this only served to make things worse later on. Do yourself a favor and be brutally honest to yourself and a-bit-less-than-brutally-honest to your companions (brutal honesty can be a bit much for some, which can cause them to use Mark's "knife" on you!) from the get-go. Those companions that appreciate the honesty are definitely worth keeping.<br/><br/><a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight"><i>Twitching with Twight</i></a>, arguably Mark's most famous essay (it's included in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill"><i>Kiss or Kill</i></a>), is a prime example of seizing control of life, cutting off the excess fat and distractions, and focusing on the goals and desires one truly wants. A key part of this is the "cutting" - often times certain objects (gear), people (significant others or friends), or mindsets (fear of failure, lack of belief of capability) hold us back from achieving our true potential. Cliche, yes, but true nonetheless. Mark discusses the "knife", referring to his ability to "cut off everything that might have held [him] back." While some view this cutting as detrimental, it can actually be quite beneficial. Take the friend who is a leech on your wellbeing or the mindset that you will never be able to climb that route or lift that much weight. Cut that friend out of your life and believe in your ability to achieve that feat - these cuts will greatly improve your life, assuming you do your part of putting in the work to achieve these goals. Mark says it best at the end of "Unlock" piece: "It [control] can start anywhere — we need only realize that the lock is within, and the key within reach. ... We learn that by taking control of ourselves we reduce the power others have over us. ... the goal of [fitness] is autonomy. It is Self-determination." (While I'm sure those that read this book are aware of Mark's background, he created the reputed <a href="https://gymjones.com/">Gym Jones</a>, hence the fitness references found throughout the book.) Unsurprisingly, Mark is a fan of Ayn Rand, referencing her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead?from_search=true&qid=ysdj3ExhFT&rank=1"><i>The Fountainhead</i></a> and acknowledging her influence in his own <i>Kiss or Kill</i>.<br/><br/>Part of this "taking control" is standing strong against the norm — one must find their own way among the vast sea of disinformation and what is considered "right" and "good". (Howard Roark, <i>The Fountainhead</i>'s protagonist, is a great example of this.) In high school, I kept my interests hidden from my friends, as it was different from what others thought a normal teenager should be doing. In hindsight, this was *somewhat* wrong. While being proud of some interested would have gotten me made fun of, others likely would not have. I now unashamedly promote most of my interests, only hiding the ones that deviate significantly from the norm. "We need more individuals, of unique opinion and voice and strength."<br/><br/>Taking and accepting risks is an important part of the human experience. They can be frightening, exhilarating, and/or wildly rewarding, depending on the venture. It is especially rewarding when that risk pays off and you grow as a person. Not much more needs to be said on this. Analyze the possible outcomes and those outcomes' outcomes and all of their respective probabilities, then make the choice to push ahead and stay back. Just make sure you won't regret it later.<br/><br/>Now, a bit about the book itself. The book is simply a series of short (1-3 page) essays. The writing can be a bit cryptic at times, as you'll know if you've read <i>Kiss or Kill</i>. This turned me off at times, but is helpful in provoking thought about what Twight meant and why he expressed it that way. It is full of images that have accompanying text: some photographs (portraits, action shots, nature-related), some renderings (not sure if that's the right word, but it's the best I have), some paintings (?).

(Objective meaning the value of stolen goods is accurate. Stolen artwork's value is difficult to quantify.) While the heist itself comprises most of the book, the authors discuss culture and industry information as needed.<br/><br/>The book is organized in rough chronological order. It begins with a detailed history of the Italian city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin">Turin</a>, where all of the thieves involved in the heist hail from. The chapter is titled <i>School of Turin</i>, referencing the not-insignificant amount of career criminals that the city produces (schools may be a better verb here). The authors describe the history and culture of the city, and how Notarbartolo, the mastermind behind the heist, fits in to the city.<br/><br/>The history and current standing of the diamond industry is provided throughout the book: culture, conflict (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_diamond">blood diamonds</a>), and standard operating procedures, among other aspects. Readers will also learn how the giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Legal_issues">De Beers unashamedly has (had?) a monopoly</a> on the diamond industry. (Consider getting your significant other a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelry/comments/3e8w8q/moissanite_vs_diamond/">moissanite stone</a> or lab-grown diamond. Significantly less expensive and conflict-free!)<br/><br/>A majority of the book details the planning, preparation, and execution of the heist. Notarbartolo spent over two years casing the building and its security before they executed. These two years were not spent waiting for the right moment - Notarbartolo was constantly taking notes and gaining information crucial to the heist (type of vault door, patterns of security, etc). He made regular trips back to Italy to consult with his partners and share his recent learnings.<br/><br/>These two long years culminated on the evening of 15 February 2003. The team was able to infiltrate the building using a homemade garage door opener (with 2^8 = 1024 possible frequencies, it is easy to iterate through the combinations to find the correct one to open the door). They proceeded to the vault, where they were able to bypass/disable three alarms/sensors: motion, sound, and a magnet inside the vault door. Once inside, the rest was easy. Using a specialized tool, the thieves were easily able to pry open a majority of the rather flimsy safety deposit boxes belonging to a variety of companies and individuals. The loot was varied: gemstones, watches, currency, securities/bonds, and personal effects. There was so much to steal that they had to leave a fair amount behind. Using a getaway car, they retreated to Notarbartolo's apartment to sift through their treasure, throwing out comparatively-worthless emeralds.<br/><br/>The following morning, each member left separately (some in groups of two) to head back to Italy while the crime was being discovered only a small distance away. One member was tasked with disposing of the trash, which included some compromising materials. He chose what turned out to be one of the unluckiest spots in all of Belgium: a forest owned by a nothing-better-to-do-than-patrol-his-land-for-litterers man. (Not to say littering is acceptable, but dumping garbage in forests is common in Belgium and not many seem to care (according to the authors).) This was the downfall of the team. The detectives were immediately dispatched to the rural plot of land and were able to begin piecing together who was behind this expensive crime. <br/><br/>After dividing their haul accordingly in the safety of Italy, Notarbartolo returned to Antwerp to tie up loose ends, unaware that he was the most-wanted man in the country. He was promptly detained along with his wife and friends, marking the beginning of his multi-year confinement (consisting of detainment and actual imprisonment). The authors briefly describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Belgium">Belgian legal system</a> and prisons in this section.<br/><br/>While in prison, Notarbartolo attempted to sell the rights to <i>his</i> story (emphasis discussed in next sentence) to multiple sources. "His" is highlighted because it varies wildly from both what the authors write here and what is probable/believable. The authors refute his account in the last section.<br/><br/>The authors preface the book by describing their research method. Throughout the book, they are careful to denote hazy, non-established points, e.g. no one knows why the thieves did this, but here's why we think they did it, etc. Notes are detailed and well-documented for further reading or referencing.<br/><br/>I see a few things wrong with the team's operation. First is the poor disposal of the garbage. To put everything together is sheer idiocy. Throwing it away in an unknown location doubles up on the foolishness. Too much of their heist was left up to blind luck (that was decreased to an extent): avoiding building guards or police, not knowing about a hidden sensor, and so on. They had over two years to prepare for the simple garbage disposal, yet failed in the worst possible way. Second is Notarbartolo's failure to place goods in his safety deposit box then proceed to rob himself (his box wasn't even opened!). He claimed that he took everything out beforehand, but even then that is suspicious. Instead, he should have placed a significant amount of material in there and simply pried open his, too. Third is their lack of Italian extradition laws. While these eventually changed under pressure from other European nations, resulting in the imprisonment of other members of the team, they would have all been safe for quite a long time had they just stayed in Italy. I suspect it would have also been more difficult to gather a case against them. Fourth, they should not have taken specifically-dated surveillance tapes, but rather all of them. This shifts focus off of those specific days and obscures the suspect list. Their disposal of the tapes was also subpar: they simply pulled them apart. Investigators were able to reconstruct them, furthering the evidence they had against the team. Surprisingly fundamental mistakes by a team intelligent enough to plan and execute a heist of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this book. It reads similar to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)"><i>Ocean's</i></a> film, except it actually happened.<br/><br/>Further reading/watching:<br/>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)"><i>Ocean's</i></a> series.

People often think climbing Everest is a simple task: go to Nepal/Tibet (there's a Tibet route), acclimate to the altitude, rent some O2 tanks, then get yourself up to the top. In reality, it is an extremely expensive ($11,000 permit just to be allowed to climb from the Nepal side) and time-consuming (two months is about average summit time) adventure.

He was quite outspoken in his belief that it was a mistake for guides to pamper their clients. 'If client cannot climb Everest without big help from guide, this client should not be on Everest. Otherwise there can be big problems up high.'" <br/><br/> Further reading:<br/>- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544564.Kiss_or_Kill?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=I3m3dPahoA&rank=4"><i>Kiss or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Mountain Climber</i></a> by Mark Twight</td></tr><tr><td>The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Confession</td><td>Leo Tolstoy</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success</td><td>Lisa Endlich</td><td>3</td><td>I am often in a pickle with some of the non-fiction books I read. The research that goes into some of them is easily five-star-quality, but the topic is so dull (to me!) that my enjoyment is a mere one- or two-star. Using this type of two-quality rating system, <i>Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success</i> deserves a solid three stars: five for research, thoroughness, and analysis, and one for my personal satisfaction.<br/><br/>Lisa Endlich, a former GS VP and trader, lays out the complete history of Goldman Sachs during its privately-owned days (inception up to May 1999, when the company went public). Chapters are separated by years, some short (Chapter 4 is 1990-1991) and some long (Chapter 2 is 1869-1976).<br/><br/>In discussing the history, the expansion into foreign/emerging markets and new geographical places is focused on. There was often debate between GS becoming a jack of all trades and master of none, or focusing on a select few business divisions and becoming the best in those. In the end, they essentially decided both. Without expanding into new businesses, the firm would not be able to expand as they wanted to.<br/><br/>Partnership is one of the common themes you will see throughout the book. To become a partner means you've made it, plain and simple. It is an exclusive, prestigious club that only a select few get the privilege of becoming a part of. Partners were inducted every X years (I forgot exactly, may be X = 1) after a lengthy, intense, and argumentative session about who should be chosen and who should be left behind. Some left the firm after being told this wasn't their year, feeling betrayed after giving their working life to the firm.<br/><br/>The subtitle, <i>The Culture of Success</i>, is also a common theme. At GS, you must be a contributor (why is this not a policy everywhere?), else you will see the door very quickly. GS attempted to recruit the smartest, hardest-working people, especially those who would put the firm at the top of their priorities. Through this selection process, the firm's culture of success and competitiveness was created.<br/><br/>While I'm sure the media contributes to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/11/goldman-sachs-doj-settlement/>modern-day image of GS</a> (sorry for paywall, but the headline is enough to make the point</a> and bankers in general, none of its misdeeds are discussed in the book, not that it was expected. A few quotes (I can't find them in the book, so take my word) struck me as funny after a GS event (see below) a few years ago: they stress the idea that customers are first and foremost in ensuring the successfulness of GS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS9r1Dk-Zg8&feature=youtu.be&t=45">GS took a position against the product they were selling to customers</a>, yet Blankfein continues to defend his firm's actions... How!<br/><br/>The later chapters are devoted to the discussion of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/other-information/ipo-prospectus-gs-pdf-file.pdf">GS's famous IPO</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Corzine">Jon Corzine</a>, former trader and then-CEO, was instrumental in convincing the partnership of selling the company to the public. This decision was made over the course of many, many years, roundtables, and hours of analysis and thinking. The IPO did not come fast enough from their final "yes", though. The market soon tumbled, and what was going to make some of the top partners $100MM+ richer soon went down into a measly (ha!) 8-figure range.<br/><br/>Some amount of financial literacy and understanding of how markets operate would help, but is not necessary.<br/><br/>For similar books, see <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254826/index.htm">Fortune's <i>The Smartest [Business] Books We Know</i></a>.

Food is allowed to be purchased, guards take bribes willingly (not sure about this one in the U.S.), and if you escape and make it out of Turkey, they will likely not pursue you, with the unspoken agreement that you will never step foot onto Turkish soil again. In the case of the prison Hayes spent most of his time in, children were in an adjacent facility, allowing them to play ball together during recesses.<br/><br/>Smuggling was commonplace throughout the prisons. Hashish (wait, what?), drugs, and other items were smuggled in by various means, such as outside workers, and sold to inmates. Billy received money hidden in books sent to him.<br/><br/>The frustration of the bureaucratic process of Hayes' case is embedded in the text. He constantly writes to a U.S. official at the embassy for assistance, but doesn't hear back for weeks at a time, only to find out the case has moved nowhere. Turkish lawyers give Hayes hope of early release after charging him hundreds or thousand of lira, then claim they haven't been able to make progress or what they said earlier didn't hold. On the bright side, Hayes' sentence was commuted several times: originally sentenced to four years, the charge was changed to smuggling from possession resulting in a standard length of life. After being bumped down to 30 years, he was granted amnesty and the sentence again commuted. Finally, good behavior knocks off a third of your final sentence length. This left Hayes with a grand total of about seven years in prison.<br/><br/>After trying multiple avenues of both legal and illegal escape (using U.S. clout, getting transferred to an insane asylum, attempting to use a file to cut the bars on his window), he settled on escaping from an island prison. Hayes swam out to anchored fishing boats, stole a small dingy, then rowed to shore, where he poorly disguised himself and was able to make his way to Greece. He was captured by Greek forces, interrogated (nicely) for a few weeks, then finally deported back to the U.S.<br/><br/>Hayes also discusses his emotional state throughout his imprisonment in regards to his parents (specifically his father), his lover (Lillian), and friendships (and sexual relations) with fellow inmates. "The emotional coldness of prison life was worth than the physical cold. Loneliness is an aching pain." Massive guilt is felt about his crime and how it has affected his parents, especially after his father's warnings about dropping out of university and going to travel the world would get him into "trouble". His father was significantly impacted financially due to lawyer fees and travel costs (later helped by the book's advance money). His lover, Lillian, was extremely supportive during his imprisonment and played a significant role in making it easier on him. Some friendships were formed, one of which turned into a sexual one through a basic need for human touch and love.<br/><br/>I think Hayes did a good job of describing both what prison life is like on the body, mind, and soul. My one takeaway (that was already well ingrained in me): don't go to prison!<br/><br/>Some further videos to watch: Wes Watson, a former <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shot%20caller">shot caller</a> in a California state prison gang, discusses his experiences in prison and why you never, ever want to go there. While the stories can't be completely corroborated, they are not unreasonable to believe. This should further viewers' desires not to end up in prison one day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWUxLYGeeIKxxioUqL54Q8g">Channel here</a>.

There is also sufficient coverage of his life before the ambassadorship and after his forced resignation.<br/><br/>Dodd, a professor of American history at University of Chicago focusing on the American South, was recommended to Roosevelt by an old friend. Having completed his PhD studies at Leipzig University in German, he was already familiar with the culture and language and could hit the ground running when he arrived. He hesitantly accepted and brought his family: wife, Mattie, daughter, Martha, and son, Bill Jr.<br/><br/>The book focuses mostly on Dodd, but a good portion is also spent on Martha and her various love affairs and doings in Berlin. Martha starts out as a Nazi sympathizer, claiming they are simply proud of their country and wanting the best for it after the disastrous WWI. She is courted by multiple Nazis, including Gestapo chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diels">Rudolf Diels</a>, and a Russian secretly working for the NKVD (Russian secret police). Her support for the Nazi party gradually wanes as she experiences more violence and discontent among German citizens.<br/><br/>Multiple people (called the Pretty Good Club (this is the only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pretty-good-club-founding-fathers/dp/0393056589">book</a> I can find on them)) in the State Department were not fans of Dodd due to his lack of prestigious upbringing (read: lack of Ivy League education) and wealth. Due to the Great Depression happening in the U.S., Dodd insisted that he should live within his modest $17500 salary. This included driving his rather outdated Chevrolet or even walking to work. These seemingly innocent actions infuriated PGC, as it insulted and tainted the prestige of the ambassador position. I must agree with Dodd's position here, even if it is a bit extreme. He cites other U.S. officials and their relatively small families living in massive homes with opulent decor and numerous servants, all of which is unnecessary (a subjective word, but likely to be generally agreed upon). Passive aggressive letters were sent by the PGC in response to Dodd's, and other letters Dodd sent that were explicitly said to be confidential were leaked to the press to stir disfavor.<br/><br/>The naivety of Dodd and other U.S. officials surprised me. While hindsight is 20/20, the gross transgressions against U.S. citizens in Germany and the gradual restriction of Jewish rights/privileges should have been dealt with more severely. Several times the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung">SA</a> attacked U.S. citizens for minor (although major for them) issues, like not saluting while a parade was going on. Nazi officials placated Dodd and others by promising these members would be brought to justice and that this type of behavior was an abnormality.<br/><br/>Major events leading up to the peak of Nazi Germany are discussed: purges (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives">Night of the Long Knives</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_in_Nazi_Germany#Laws">controversial laws</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#Dictatorship">changes in the governmental structure</a> (the most significant, in my opinion, was the death of German president Hindenburg and Hitler's immediate consolidation of the position of president and chancellor, which effectively gave him complete control of the government), and events that affected the U.S.-Germany relationship (1934 Mock Trial of Hitler), among many others.<br/><br/>In the Sources and Acknowledgment sections, Larson discusses his sources and which ones were more valuable for his "particular parcel of ground", rather than just general histories of Nazi Germany or WWII. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34442928-ambassador-dodd-s-diary?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=nkLomb0q1e&rank=1"><i>Ambassador Dodd's Diary</i></a> (no reviews??) and Martha's memoir, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11726930-through-embassy-eyes?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kazTAuW6hp&rank=1"><i>Through Embassy Eyes</i></a>, were particularly helpful in getting a glimpse into both of their thought processes and obtaining direct quotes. University libraries (Yale, Harvard, Columbia) and public resources were also used. Larson explains his careful cross-examination of sources to verify information. This section is greatly appreciated - it gives credibility to the information and the further reading can be especially guiding to those interested in this topic/time period. A standard list of sources is included after the source discussion.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent book that provides a unique perspective that I, and likely many others, never considered. I highly recommend reading this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Marley and Me: Life and Love With the World's Worst Dog</td><td>John Grogan</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>A Tale of Two Cities</td><td>Charles Dickens</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Tactical Barbell: Definitive Strength Training for the Operational Athlete</td><td>K Black</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Kiss or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Climber</td><td>Mark Twight</td><td>4</td><td>I first heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twight">Mark Twight</a> back into 2010 through <a href="https://gymjones.com/">Gym Jones</a>, a "cult"gym in Salt Lake City. Their approach to and mindset about training was quite different from Globo Gyms (of course) and even other non-conventional training methods, like Crossfit. You can see more about Gym Jones philosophy <a href="https://gymjones.com/knowledge/articles">here</a>.<br/><br/>Kiss or Kill is not a traditional book, but rather a series of Twight's essays concatenated together with pictures of various mountains, climbing, and other things, such as <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1066/1020/files/img086_Email_Lr.jpg?13387639341954045433">this photo</a>, captioned "Saying hello and goodbye to France, and the press in general." These essays were all penned pre-2001 (publication date), so Twight includes a "2000 Author's Note" at the end of each to reflect on what he thinks of the essays now and anything left unwritten.<br/><br/>The essays are a combination of Twight's philosophy and climbing stories (with his philosophy indirectly explained). <br/><br/>His <b>obsession</b> (that's what it is, no less) with climbing is impressive. He ruined relationships (both friendships and marriages) and risked in his life many a time in pursuit of pushing the limits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering#Alpine_style">alpining</a>. He remains cognizant of his decisions and how they affected both himself and others, yet continues in this fashion to keep doing what he loves: climbing mountains.<br/><br/>His writing is surprisingly good, both in describing his thought processes and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twight#Climbing">insane climbs he and others completed and attempted</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84418756-twitching-with-twight">Twitching With Twight</a> (5 min read) does the best job of describing Twight's philosophy without embedding it into a climbing story. Twight lives by this without deviation. He learned the reality of his own selfishness. He lived with commitment to his climbing career and nothing else. Most importantly, he lived for himself and no one else (not surprisingly, he acknowledges Ayn Rand at the end).<br/><br/>Overall, any mountaineer/alpinist would likely enjoy this book for its history aspect (Twight made the first ascents on quite a few routes), while non-climbers may still find it interesting for its imagery. Climbing aside, everyone can learn something from his philosophy.</td></tr><tr><td>The A to Z of Sexspionage</td><td>Nigel West</td><td>4</td><td>Disclaimer: I did not read the entire book, just the "A" section and skimmed important cases from the remaining 25 sections (yes, it's literally A to Z).<br/><br/>The book begins with a chronology of major sexspionage cases and an introduction into what sexspionage is and how it's used in modern espionage.<br/><br/>The main part of the book is a comprehensive dictionary of sexspionage cases conducted by all nations (U.S., Russia, Cuba, etc). Each case is thoroughly detailed with names, dates, locations, explanations, and conclusions (to both the case itself and the individual). References to other cases are also included when applicable.<br/><br/>Important cases include the following: Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, Martin Luther King Jr., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>, and Leon Trotsky. Concepts/definitions and their applications and history are defined, such as homosexuality and profiling.<br/><br/>Sexspionage is an important subset of espionage and intelligence and a good book to have at least skimmed for an espionage history enthusiast.

Their realizing that NK is not what the regime says is gradual. It begins with noticing the electricity is intermittent: sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. Then it progresses to lack of food and salary. (Their assigned jobs normally gave them paychecks and foodstamp-equivalents to pay for basic items and get their three daily meal.) Salaries dwindled down to nothing and foodstamps provided three, then two, then a measly one meal per day (and even that one meal regressed in size). Propaganda offset the frustration by encouraging one meal a day to help their country and blaming capitalism for preventing food deliveries. Black markets thrived, with authorities turning a blind eye, as they were also hungry.<br/><br/>Hunger was a large focus of the book. To make up for lack of food and lack of money to purchase food, people got creative (as we normally do when faced with a life-or-death situation). They traveled far into the countryside to raid orchards. They peeled bark off of trees, ground it into a coarse powder, then boiled it into soup, along with freshly-picked grass from the side of the road. They picked from the excrement of animals to salvage undigested food. Some opened up illegal gardens in their backyards. Roaming gangs of children, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotjebi">kotjebi</a>, would rush markets, knocking over the stall and its vendor and grabbing as much food as possible. Children were admitted to hospitals due to intense stomach aches caused by inedible items used as food that their immature stomachs couldn't process. Prostitution was common, with payment being in form of food.<br/><br/>Another focus was propaganda and the "brainwashing" (should that really be in quotes?) of the citizens. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim il-Sung</a> (the original leader of North Korea) died in 1994 and caused a week of lamentation across the entire country. People never considered the fact that their "Great Leader" (how they refer to him) could actually die. This caused huge concern about the future: if Kim il-Sung could die, anything could happen. Children were taught songs, one of which's had a phrase that included the title of the book. (I find this quite ironic, as it can take on two meanings. They are completely satisfied and have nothing they envy of others, or they have nothing that others would envy of them. The latter seems much more applicable.) To maintain the stature of the leader, insults or derogatory remarks about them resulted in hard labor camps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_North_Korea"> more on NK prisons here</a>) and even executions (which were performed regularly). Everyone was encouraged to spy on their neighbors for any signs of lack of allegiance.<br/><br/>One side note on NK giving up their nuclear weapons (briefly discussed in the book). I attended a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Lord">Winston Lord</a>, who is currently on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Human_Rights_in_North_Korea">U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a>. During the Q&A portion, someone asked his thoughts about the NK nuclear situation. He was firm in his response: NK will never give up their nuclear weapons. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi">Qaddafi</a> gave up his WMDs, we left him high and dry. NK apparently (I haven't been able to find a source - please reply to this if you can find one!) released an official statement saying something along the lines of "we now know what happens when a country gives up their WMDs". While I hope denuclearization does happen, I must agree with Lord. NK's WMDs and the supposed hundreds of missiles pointing at SK are the only things stopping the regime from being removed.</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesdays with Morrie</td><td>Mitch Albom</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</td><td>Christopher McDougall</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Catch-22 (Catch-22, #1)</td><td>Joseph Heller</td><td>1</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Amber Spyglass  (His Dark Materials, #3)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1)</td><td>Philip Pullman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Son (The Giver Quartet, #4)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gossamer</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Soldiers Of Reason: The RAND Corporation And The Rise Of The American Empire</td><td>Alex Abella</td><td>3</td><td>Soldiers of Reason details the history of RAND, from its inception to modern times (well, 2008, when the book was published). Abella discusses and details both the important periods of time/events RAND was involved in (Cold War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, Iraq War, Watergate, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.), as well as the notable people involved (Henry Kissinger, Paul Wolfowitz and others) and the role they played in guiding both the organization itself and the government (exclusively the U.S., up until the 2000's) it served.<br/><br/>RAND, standing for Research ANd Development, was established to assist the U.S. Air Force in various research capacities. It attracted a wide-range of academics, from physicists to social scientists and everyone in between. Nuclear war was the primary focus in the early stages of RAND, where the researchers asked questions about preemptive strikes, strategic locations of munitions and vehicles, and the status of the Soviet's nuclear program. Game theory was researched by John Von Neumann (arguably the greatest polymath of all-time) and others to be applied to the Soviet threat.<br/><br/>During the Vietnam War, RAND analysts participated by interviewing North Vietnamese prisoners-of-war to learn about their motivation. After finding out that the Vietcong "described themselves as patriots leading a war of national liberation", the analysts realized the war would be a lot more difficult than initially anticipated. However, it was not their place to decide what was right or wrong, difficult or easy: their job was to synthesize the data and report it. Like America at the time, a large rift was created between RAND employees: pro-war and anti-war. Daniel Ellsberg, part of the anti-war faction, was the RAND employee who leaked what is known as the Pentagon Papers, documents detailing the truth on what the U.S. government was really doing in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In addition to international assignments, RAND also accepted commissions concerning domestic matters, such as one from New York City's mayor John Lindsay to study reformation of the city's unpopular government. Other federal entities, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have also sought RAND's abilities in improving their methods.<br/><br/>The book's last few chapters discuss terrorism and RAND's role in working with and assisting the U.S. government in combating it.<br/><br/>RAND is still alive and well today (rand.org). Their website details all of their research areas and divisions, the reports they publish, the experts they employ, and their abilities. They even have a graduate school for public policy.<br/><br/>Despite being mostly in the shadows, RAND has and will continue to play a large (the importance is subjective) role in shaping and guiding U.S. policy for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Overall, a run-of-the-mill nonfiction book detailing the history of a company. Definitely boring at times, but interesting at others.</td></tr><tr><td>Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon</td><td>Kim Zetter</td><td>5</td><td>A thoroughly-researched book that examines the both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"> Stuxnet virus</a> and cyberwarfare policy individually, as well as their crossroads as it relates to the modern era.<br/><br/>Zetter's descriptions and explanations of all things technical is phenomenal. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_centrifuge">uranium-enriching centrifuges</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">zero-day computer exploits</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA">SCADA</a>, they are simplified enough for the layperson to understand without sacrificing information. Little to no technical background is required to understand the technology discussed, although it certainly doesn't hurt. <br/><br/>The book details the investigation (and obsession) of Stuxnet by a select number of security researchers and firms spread across the world. Zetter describes the researchers' process into dissecting the incredibly complex <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2010-071400-3123-99">Stuxnet code</a> (I suggest reading through this link, as Symantec was one of those "select number of security researchers and firms") and how they were finally able to understand its final payload.<br/><br/>U.S. cybersecurity and cyberwarfare policy, general cyber "philosophy" (for lack of a better term), and the legality of cyber operations are also discussed. Should zero-day exploits be able to be sold to the highest bidder, whether that be a nation-state or terror group? Do zero-day researchers have an obligation to disclose said exploit to the respective software? How should we respond to zero-day offensives aimed at the U.S? (Hint: depending on the severity of the attack, it may be considered an act of war, and you don't want to be on the wrong side of America when that happens.) Zetter describes what the U.S.' current policy is towards these questions and what discussions are taking place, albeit behind closed doors. <br/><br/>Even if you don't care about the Stuxnet virus or its impact, the cyber aspect of the book is extremely important to understand in this day and age. Our lives are becoming evermore electronically interconnected (phones connect to computers to cars to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-refrigerator-4158327">refrigerators</a> (wait, what?) to watches), and with it comes vulnerabilities. While those are small-scale connections, compromising large-scale systems has the potential to kill individuals and ravage society: economic markets, power grids, transportation networks, healthcare systems, and computing centers. While there is little ordinary citizens can do to help prevent this, it helps to be informed on issues like this.</td></tr><tr><td>Number the Stars</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Tale of Despereaux</td><td>Kate DiCamillo</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The City of Ember (Book of Ember, #1)</td><td>Jeanne DuPrau</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</td><td>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</td><td>5</td><td>Review summary: An enjoyable (can I say that with what this book is about?) read about a horrific historical time period. Solzhenitsyn, with the translation help of Willetts, does a good job of describing the human condition in the face of evil and how it was managed over many years.<br/><br/>The book accounts details the fictional Ivan Denisovich's (Shukhov, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Slavic_naming_customs">Slavic naming conventions</a> can help here, and in other Russian novels) experiences in one of Stalin's forced labor camps. Forced to confess he was a German spy, this account was taken during around his seventh year in prison.<br/><br/>Despite the horrible conditions they faced, there was plenty of time for happiness to be felt in the form of tobacco, warmth, and Sundays off (quite similar to what non-prisoners enjoy!). As the final paragraph begins: "Shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep. A lot of good things had happened that day." An important lesson can be learned from this: despite harrowing conditions, happiness can still be felt in the form of hope (e.g. your prison sentence ending) or temporary relief (e.g. a cigarette). <br/><br/>The treatment of the prisoners was better than what I was expecting, although I'm not sure how much was censored by the USSR. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956?ac=1&from_search=true">Gulag Archipelago</a>, also by Solzhenitsyn, is supposedly more brutal and uncensored than <i>One Day</i>, which, not coincidentally, he was not allowed to publish in the USSR.<br/><br/>While I'm not a Russian speaker, Willetts seemed to do an adequate job of translating the humor and messages (after all, it's the only authorized version of this book).<br/><br/><i>One Day</i> and <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> are two important books about a terrible time in world history. OD is a bit more accessible (shorter, less descriptive), while TGA is out of reach/interest for many readers (~2000 pages across three volumes, vivid imagery = darker). I will tackle TGA at some point and compare with this.<br/><br/>For historical background, Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">Gulag</a> article is well-researched, descriptive, and comprehensive if you are looking to learn more about this time period.</td></tr><tr><td>Being Peace (Being Peace, #1)</td><td>Thich Nhat Hanh</td><td>2</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Sound and the Fury</td><td>William Faulkner</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Brave New World</td><td>Aldous Huxley</td><td>4</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10</td><td>Marcus Luttrell</td><td>3</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Godfather</td><td>Mario Puzo</td><td>5</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Radioactivity: A History of a Mysterious Science</td><td>Marjorie C.

In the helicopter ride-along he learns about the ideal city layout for policing, and other small bits of knowledge about "bulgar theory" and policing methods.<br/><br/>A good portion of the book consists of anecdotes to complement his learnings and give some practical (although some of them are not so practical!) examples of real-life burglaries. He discusses tunneling into bank vaults (<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/thieves-use-sewage-pipes-tunnels-to-break-into-bank-vault-full-of-jewels-in-antwerps-diamond-district"> yes, this does happen</a>) and using social engineering to fool companies into sending you master key cards.<br/><br/>Manaugh briefly discusses the legal theory behind burglary. What is considered a building? When and where are you considered to be "inside" of a building? Some states take into account intent, meaning if you have suspicious items on you, despite a perfectly good explanation for each, you can still be charged with a crime.<br/><br/>An important topic discussed towards the book's end is that of "<a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2010/01/nakatomi-space/">Nakatomi Space</a>", named after the plaza in the movie Die Hard, where the protagonist travels around a skyscraper uses everything <u>but</u> conventional methods. The independent research Gwern discusses Nakatomi Space and some of its applications in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c0nqg7/people_seem_to_think_thieves_should_lockpick_or/er6huvz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app">this Reddit comment</a>.<br/><br/>My biggest takeaway from this book is using objects in manners they are <u>not</u> meant to be used in, e.g. enter a room through the thin drywall rather than the reinforced steel door with three deadbolts and a booby trap. It is through this outside-of-the-box thinking that the most successful burglars have gotten away with crimes.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</td><td>Alexandra David-Néel</td><td>5</td><td>Magic and Mystery in Tibet provides an excellent summary of Tibetan practices, beliefs, and culture in the beginning of the 20th century. If anyone has a suggestion for a more modern book detailing similar information, I'd love to hear it.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_David-N%C3%A9el">Alexandra David-Néel</a> is a French linguist and Buddhist who has spent significant time traveling in and around Tibet.<br/><br/>The book is split up into eight chapters: Tibet and the Lamas, A Guest of the Lamas, A Famous Tibetan Monastery, Dealing with Ghosts and Demons, Disciples of Yore and Their Contemporary Emulators, Psychic Sports, Mystic Theories and Spiritual Training, and Psychic Phenomena in Tibet - How Tibetans Explain Them.<br/><br/>Each chapter is a mix of her travels in Tibet and Tibetan practices as they relate to the chapter's title. She gives detailed background information about the practices: how they began, what Tibetans believe about them, and how the practices are actually performed. Take, for example,  <i> lung-gom </i>, a type of training that is said to "develop uncommon nimbleness and especially enables its adepts to take extraordinarily long tramps with amazing rapidity". David-Néel describes her interactions with <i> lung-gom-pas </i>, first encountering one in Chang thang of Northern Tibet, then another who was wearing iron chains to prevent himself from floating off into space (since the training supposedly makes you lighter than air). She then describes the training itself: jumping cross-legged from the bottom of a pit and crawling through a minuscule hole from a cell they've been in for seven days. Throughout these descriptions, she explains the Tibetans' reasoning and thoughts behind why and how these work. Complementary anecdotes and folklore are also shared throughout the book. This process is used for the most of the Tibetan practices and culture she describes.<br/><br/>There is a lot of mysticism and spiritual belief that David-Néel does a good (and respectful) job of not diminishing, but rather objectively explains their perspective. The book ends in a request for scientists to "undertake serious investigations of the phenomena [which David-Néel experienced]", as some of the events she describes are seemingly unexplainable. Considering this was written in the 1930s, I am curious to see how much, if any, Tibetan beliefs have changed in regard to these subjects since then.<br/><br/>There is little concept of time throughout (no "in 19XX I did this"), but she does mention this book is the culmination of over 10 years of research and studying.<br/><br/>Pictures are mostly of persons, but also include some places.</td></tr><tr><td>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society</td><td>Dave Grossman</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger (The Giver, #3)</td><td>Lois Lowry</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>I Am the Messenger</td><td>Markus Zusak</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Notebook of Leonardo Da Vinci</td><td>Leonardo da Vinci</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Extraordinary Voyages, #6)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Mysterious Island (Extraordinary Voyages, #12)</td><td>Jules Verne</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Pearl</td><td>John Steinbeck</td><td>0</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again</td><td>J.R.R.
