  Yet another mad-libbed detective show: a protagonist who is struggling in their personal life while having to fulfill their police duties. At this point, a plot twist isn't a plot twist. It's an expected element that's predictable. There's marital issues, jealousy, friendship conflicts, and everything that goes into a typical detective show. Admittedly, there were two plot twists, which added some amount of surprise.
</p>

<p>
  I am pleasantly surprised that the good guy I was rooting for, Colin, died. That's life. The person you want to make it through doesn't always live. GRRM apparently does a good job of this in GoT. I am also happy within Kate Winslet's weight: her body was how I would expect a woman-in-her-position's body to look (and I don't mean that in a condescending, ugly way). It didn't stand out much and wasn't excessively fit.
</p>

<p>
  One idea I have for detective shows is to hide both the amount of episodes and runtime of each episode, unless the viewer specifically navigates to see those. This would prevent viewers from saying "oh, this isn't the guy" when there are two episodes left and they seemingly bagged their culprit.

  Another Nolan-esque film with a distinct style of storytelling and an unheard of plot. Two storylines are presented: one going forwards in time, the other backwards. They eventually converge at the end of the film, but in the middle of the story.
</p>

<p>
  Is that really what it's like to have short-term memory loss? Do people not believe you, questioning your claims and testing your abilities and chastising your forgetfulness and mistakes? Take colorblind people. They are constantly being asked what color this or that is, as if they are faking and the questioner needs proof. Are people really that cold-hearted enough to take advantage of you when they know they won't be caught and there is virtually no downside to it? Do you really begin to go crazy like Leonard did, wondering what's real and what's fake and why you crossed that out and wrote that and what you were thinking at that time and what actually just happened and why you're in some random dude's motel room and why that guy's chasing you with a gun?
</p>

<p>
  The viewer begins to take on the perspective of Leonard after deceit is seen and things don't add up. Guesses are made at one minute, then changed once the backwards story rewinds a bit to see the previous events, and again and again and again...

  Nolan swings and hits again with a very, very novel concept: reversing time. Note this is not time-travel as most people understand (read: think about). Rather, from t=X where X > 0, time starts to go backwards towards 0, while the person who is reversed (or inverted, as they call it), is experiencing his own thoughts normally, but the world "in reverse". It takes some thinking and getting used to, evident by all of my friends who watched it being incredibly confused during and directly after the movie. Similar novelty to Inception—something that hasn't been made before, thought of before. The layers of inversion add complexity to it in the same sense the dream within a dream ... within a dream does.
</p>

<p>
  One nice touch/detail I particularly enjoyed was Neil's quote "What's happened, happened." While simple on its face, it explains a lot of the movie's sequences. Take the heist scene in Tallinn, specifically the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suwnd4xWn98">highway part</a> and seeing the SUV driving at them in reverse, then throwing the package across the hood of the other car (i.e., the car in between the middle of The Protagonist/Neil and Sator's men), it turns out the driver of the middle car is actually The Protagonist in reverse, come back in time via turnstile to save Kat. Same with the turnstile-SWAT scene in the vault.
</p>

<p>
  Poor audio mixing has been a complaint of many about this film, especially in theaters, but I didn't notice it (I also used subtitles). Soundtrack was solid and really added to the movie.
</p>

<p>
  On top of the conceptual aspects is a fun, thrilling spy movie complete with action and suspense.

<h2 id="queens_gambit">The Queen's Gambit (7.2)</h2>

</p>

<ul>

    Date watched: 27 November 2020 - 01 December 2020

    Originally a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62022.The_Queen_s_Gambit">novel</a> by Walter Tevis
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, <i>The Queen's Gambit</i> follows the rise of Beth Harmon through the ranks of the chess world, beginning with matches against her orphanage's janitor in the basement and culminating in defeating the world champion Borgov in Moscow (during the Cold War, mind you!).
</p>

<p>
  Chess is only one theme among many. Harmon goes through her life without biological parents, getting adopted by a manipulative mother and a father who leaves soon thereafter, a few friends, one of whom is from the orphanage and the others through chess. She struggles with addiction to alcohol and anti-anxiety medication (librium) that she became dependent on at the orphanage. She first feels love and eventually has emotionless one-night stands with friends. She is subject to the bright spotlight that world-class chess players experience, in addition to an even brighter one due to her being a world-class <i>female</i> chess player.
</p>

<p>
  I see a few parallels between the chess board and Harmon's loneliness in life. In chess, you and your pieces are all alone—no one else can help and all moves directly help or hurt your cause. This principle can be applied to some people's lives: they are all alone (no parents or others to help them) and all decisions improve or worsen their lives. Harmon had no one to blame for her wins or losses, in both chess and life. She chose to take the librium regularly (this is arguable, as she was a young child and addiction to a feeling like that is a powerful thing), she chose alcohol and benders over continuing to play, etc. On the flip side, there are some things in both you can't control: your opponent's moves and other's moves, respectively. In her first match against Watts, she is ill-prepared and experiences her first loss ever. Yet there is little to nothing she could have done. Sure, more preparation would do <i>some</i> good, but part of chess is knowing how to respond to certain setups and moves, resulting in sometimes losing due to holes in your knowledge. The important aspect is learning from the loss and applying those lessons into preparation for future games, a principle that can easily be applied to life in general: lose &#8594; learn &#8594; apply &#8594; lose &#8594; ... &#8594; win. Rinse and repeat as needed for specific applications and until you stop losing.
</p

<p>
  In regards to reception, quite a few high-profile players have supported the series. Chess.com even released a <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/play-beth-harmon">Beth Harmon bot</a>, allowing challengers to play her at ages 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 20, 22, all with their respective ratings.
</p>

<p>
  The acting is good on all fronts.
