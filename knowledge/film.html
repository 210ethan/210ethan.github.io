<h2 id="resident_evil_raccoon">Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City (4.3)</h2>

<p>
  The water must have made the main character stupid as well. Do people never learn in horror movies?! A few prime examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The scientist who warned Claire Redfield about the T-virus was locked up with a guy who most obviously had been infected. Said scientist had a gun, yet still managed to get bitten and die. (Also, he never turned into a zombie??)
  </li>
  <li>
    Claire sent an obviously inept police officer to check out yelling and screaming in the cell room, despite her just saving him a minute prior.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the Spencer Mansion, the two police officers (not Wesker and the girl) found a zombie, killed him, and then separated to search for another guy. You just witnessed a ravenous zombie chewing on the flesh of some dude and you decide to split up?!
  </li>
  <li>
    Out of all the zombies killed, every single one was by a head shot. The good guys never seemed to understand this pattern.
  </li>
  <li>
    After battling dozens of zombies, one officer found his (zombiefied) colleague and proceeds to ask if he's okay even after seeing his discolored and flesh-covered face.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As expected, gun use and realisticness was subpar (although I noticed decent trigger discipline!). They expended entire magazines on individual zombies, they used the infamous unlimited ammo cheat, they didn't aim down the sights. The helicopter ride scene to the mansion was pretty sweet.
</p>

<p>
  The opportunity for a sequel is left open at the end by hinting at Wesker's origin story and showing the others as escaping from Raccoon City.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, a pretty bad movie with money-grab vibes. Like the other Resident Evils after Apocalypse, this probably shouldn't have been created.
</p>

  Exactly what I expected. Cool fight scenes, cheesy quotes, and some amount of unrealistic moves that help Stallone escape.
</p>

<p>
  There were a few issues with the ship's prison. If this was truly a for-profit prison that abided by no one's laws, then why take them out of their cells out at all? If I were an evil prison warden, every prisoner would stay in their cell 24/7/365. Absolutely no leaving it. The only communication to the outside world would be through me. The doctor would be under strict watch at all times, as would all of the guards. Further, why not just execute the ones who aren't needed anymore? Take Breslin, who was locked up to prevent him from embarrassing other prison wardens. Why not just kill him and avoid all the annoyance that comes with containing him? As for the ones who need to be kept alive to get information, that is another story.
</p>

<p>
  I really liked the plot twist of Rottmayer being Mannheim and his daughter actually being in the CIA. Was not expecting that one.
</p>

<p>
  I was also surprised how Breslin literally killed two guys in the beginning scene to get to the SHU, and then was let off scot-free. Seriously?!
</p>

<h2 id="squid_game">Squid Game (8.4)</h2>

<p>
  Info:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Date watched: 10-15 October 2021
  </li>
  <li>
    Length: 9 episodes, ~9:00 hr
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The mood is set early into the first episode. Gi-hun's sad, lonely life is explained through his gambling, desperation, and mother's shaming. Pity and disgust are simultaneously felt, one side saying he's sick, he's not right in the head, and the other saying he's failed his own mother and daughter, he's a weak man. A too-good-to-be-true opportunity presents itself, setting the stage for the games to begin.
</p>

<p>
  The writer/director/whoever did an excellent job of making things known without explicitly saying so. After the gangster player kills the man and the prize money increases, the precedent is set and everyone, including the viewer, knows it: murder is fair game. But this fails to align with equality, the theme of the games. Players' ability to kill differs drastically. Il-nam can't stop an attack from an average adult male, nor would most women.
</p>

<p>
  Two desires are examined throughout the series: that to be alive, and that to become wealthy. The latter transitions to the former as the games get more intense and deadly. The final game becomes a battle for survival first and riches second, if being considered at all.
</p>

<p>
  The final twist is unexpected. I initially thought it a ploy by the organization to get Gi-hun into a private room, then thought it was a lookalike Il-nam, then came to terms that it was actually him. I took his enthusiasm throughout the games as either senility—a lack of awareness of the true stakes—or apathy stemming from his inoperable brain tumor.

  What a disappointing end to such an awesome era of Bond films. There are only a handful of things that can ruin an action movie for me: cheesy quotes and <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=plot%20armor">plot armor</a>. Throughout the film Bond becomes an absolute softie towards Madeleine Swann, beginning with a romantic trip to Italy and culminating in him watching an incoming missile and saying "I have always loved you". Seriously? The plot armor is equally as bad: while fighting on the island, he is standing in a wide-open space as five goons are unloading full-auto rifles at him. Miraculously, he manages to <i>walk</i> (not run!) to cover without being hit and proceeds to kill all of them without effort. While not getting hit is fine under some circumstances, no cover plus five machine guns is not one of them.
</p>

<p>
  The action and cinematography were both solid.
</p>

<p>
  The plot was confusing. It seems Safin's only beef with James was because of his relationship with Swann, but otherwise there's no real reason behind wanting to take over the world. Paloma, the Cuban spy who helps Bond kick ass in Cuba, is set up to be a contributing character, but ends up being only featured in the Cuba scene and nothing else.

  Yet another mad-libbed detective show: a protagonist who is struggling in their personal life while having to fulfill their police duties. At this point, a plot twist isn't a plot twist. It's an expected element that's predictable. There's marital issues, jealousy, friendship conflicts, and everything that goes into a typical detective show. Admittedly, there were two plot twists, which added some amount of surprise.
</p>

<p>
  I am pleasantly surprised that the good guy I was rooting for, Colin, died. That's life. The person you want to make it through doesn't always live. GRRM apparently does a good job of this in GoT. I am also happy within Kate Winslet's weight: her body was how I would expect a woman-in-her-position's body to look (and I don't mean that in a condescending, ugly way). It didn't stand out much and wasn't excessively fit.
</p>

<p>
  One idea I have for detective shows is to hide both the amount of episodes and runtime of each episode, unless the viewer specifically navigates to see those. This would prevent viewers from saying "oh, this isn't the guy" when there are two episodes left and they seemingly bagged their culprit.

  Another Nolan-esque film with a distinct style of storytelling and an unheard of plot. Two storylines are presented: one going forwards in time, the other backwards. They eventually converge at the end of the film, but in the middle of the story.
</p>

<p>
  Is that really what it's like to have short-term memory loss? Do people not believe you, questioning your claims and testing your abilities and chastising your forgetfulness and mistakes? Take colorblind people. They are constantly being asked what color this or that is, as if they are faking and the questioner needs proof. Are people really that cold-hearted enough to take advantage of you when they know they won't be caught and there is virtually no downside to it? Do you really begin to go crazy like Leonard did, wondering what's real and what's fake and why you crossed that out and wrote that and what you were thinking at that time and what actually just happened and why you're in some random dude's motel room and why that guy's chasing you with a gun?
</p>

<p>
  The viewer begins to take on the perspective of Leonard after deceit is seen and things don't add up. Guesses are made at one minute, then changed once the backwards story rewinds a bit to see the previous events, and again and again and again...

  Nolan swings and hits again with a very, very novel concept: reversing time. Note this is not time-travel as most people understand (read: think about). Rather, from t=X where X > 0, time starts to go backwards towards 0, while the person who is reversed (or inverted, as they call it), is experiencing his own thoughts normally, but the world "in reverse". It takes some thinking and getting used to, evident by all of my friends who watched it being incredibly confused during and directly after the movie. Similar novelty to Inception—something that hasn't been made before, thought of before. The layers of inversion add complexity to it in the same sense the dream within a dream ... within a dream does.
</p>

<p>
  One nice touch/detail I particularly enjoyed was Neil's quote "What's happened, happened." While simple on its face, it explains a lot of the movie's sequences. Take the heist scene in Tallinn, specifically the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suwnd4xWn98">highway part</a> and seeing the SUV driving at them in reverse, then throwing the package across the hood of the other car (i.e., the car in between the middle of The Protagonist/Neil and Sator's men), it turns out the driver of the middle car is actually The Protagonist in reverse, come back in time via turnstile to save Kat. Same with the turnstile-SWAT scene in the vault.
</p>

<p>
  Poor audio mixing has been a complaint of many about this film, especially in theaters, but I didn't notice it (I also used subtitles). Soundtrack was solid and really added to the movie.
</p>

<p>
  On top of the conceptual aspects is a fun, thrilling spy movie complete with action and suspense.

<h2 id="queens_gambit">The Queen's Gambit (7.2)</h2>

<p>
  Info:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Date watched: 27 November 2020 - 01 December 2020

  <li>
    Length: 7 episodes, 6:33 hr

    Originally a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62022.The_Queen_s_Gambit">novel</a> by Walter Tevis
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, <i>The Queen's Gambit</i> follows the rise of Beth Harmon through the ranks of the chess world, beginning with matches against her orphanage's janitor in the basement and culminating in defeating the world champion Borgov in Moscow (during the Cold War, mind you!).
</p>

<p>
  Chess is only one theme among many. Harmon goes through her life without biological parents, getting adopted by a manipulative mother and a father who leaves soon thereafter, a few friends, one of whom is from the orphanage and the others through chess. She struggles with addiction to alcohol and anti-anxiety medication (librium) that she became dependent on at the orphanage. She first feels love and eventually has emotionless one-night stands with friends. She is subject to the bright spotlight that world-class chess players experience, in addition to an even brighter one due to her being a world-class <i>female</i> chess player.
</p>

<p>
  I see a few parallels between the chess board and Harmon's loneliness in life. In chess, you and your pieces are all alone—no one else can help and all moves directly help or hurt your cause. This principle can be applied to some people's lives: they are all alone (no parents or others to help them) and all decisions improve or worsen their lives. Harmon had no one to blame for her wins or losses, in both chess and life. She chose to take the librium regularly (this is arguable, as she was a young child and addiction to a feeling like that is a powerful thing), she chose alcohol and benders over continuing to play, etc. On the flip side, there are some things in both you can't control: your opponent's moves and other's moves, respectively. In her first match against Watts, she is ill-prepared and experiences her first loss ever. Yet there is little to nothing she could have done. Sure, more preparation would do <i>some</i> good, but part of chess is knowing how to respond to certain setups and moves, resulting in sometimes losing due to holes in your knowledge. The important aspect is learning from the loss and applying those lessons into preparation for future games, a principle that can easily be applied to life in general: lose &#8594; learn &#8594; apply &#8594; lose &#8594; ... &#8594; win. Rinse and repeat as needed for specific applications and until you stop losing.
</p

<p>
  In regards to reception, quite a few high-profile players have supported the series. Chess.com even released a <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/play-beth-harmon">Beth Harmon bot</a>, allowing challengers to play her at ages 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 20, 22, all with their respective ratings.
</p>

<p>
  The acting is good on all fronts.
