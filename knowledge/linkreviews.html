</p>

<p>
  I think I suffer a bit from SAD. I get a bit melancholy in the winter months, and especially on days with overcast weather/little sunlight.
</p>

<p>
  The author brings up a valid point: purported lux means nothing if the distance is unaccounted for. But I doubt companies care or (most) consumers understand.
</p>

<p>
  I appreciate him taking the solution into his own hands by using light bars. A few friends have them on their trucks and holy cowâ€”they are bright! It seems a lot of times people think that "industrial-grade" objects can't be used in a personal-grade setting, when in fact they may be even better. (Never make the mistake of thinking that military-grade = better!) I don't have any examples off the top of my head, but I'm sure they're out there.

  While he never explicitly mentions that your eyes <i>must</i> be exposed, it is true. From <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seasonal-affective-disorder-bring-on-the-light-201212215663">Harvard Health Blog</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Bright light works by stimulating cells in the retina that connect to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that helps control circadian rhythms. Activating the hypothalamus at a certain time every day can restore a normal circadian rhythm and thus banish seasonal symptoms.

  One commenter says:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Studies found that it is more beneficial to have the light enter your eyes from above your head. The light from the Day-Light Sky enters your eyes from ABOVE like the sun hits your eyes, in real life. It is important that the lamp projects 10,000 lux that light therapy professionals recommend for therapeutic use.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I am skeptical of this, but open to reading any paper regarding this.

  So far I have a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/general-electric-150w-a23-ultra-bright-aline-led-daylight/-/A-80131512#lnk=sametab">2610 lumen bulb</a> in my room (supplemented by a 1600 lumen one). I will look into the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WDFTHXB/?tag=meaningness-20">48,000 lumen stadium light</a> he recommends, but likely at a lower wattage/luminosity.
