<h2 id="24_hours">Living on 24 Hours a Day</h2>

<p>
  Link: <a href="https://www.justindfuller.com/2022/01/living-on-24-hours-a-day/">Living on 24 Hours a Day</a>
</p>

<p>
  This is a summary of Arnold Bennet's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4855.How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a>, but considering it's only 50 pages long, probably gives a decent idea of the book.
</p>

<p>
  This is a concept I've been thinking about for some time after starting full-time work. Those precious eight hours are all we have to pursue our outside-of-work hobbies and interests, plus the two 16-hour days on the weekend. And yet, people often squander this time for arguably fruitless, unrewarding, mindless activities: video games, YouTube, Reddit, social media, and so on. There are very few times in my older life (i.e., after the age of 16) that I found value in mindlessly [insert verb from the earlier list]-ing. That's not to say I haven't gotten value from those activities: video games gave me time with friends I wouldn't have otherwise talked to; YouTube taught me things I wouldn't have otherwise been able to learn; Reddit connected me with others I wouldn't have otherwise met.
</p>

<p>
  But it's when these are done <i>mindlessly</i> that it becomes the issue. Time goes by faster when doing this. What feels like 30 minutes turns out to be two hours and it's time for bed and the day has been wasted with no reward. I've also noticed my day feels significantly fuller than those mindless days. A solid day for me outside of work includes exercise, working on this website, and doing something fun (exercising/websiting are obviously fun to me, but something others also find fun: reading, developing a skill, spending time with friends).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wake up early
  </li>
  <li>
    Productive exercise
  </li>
  <li>
    Productive work day
  </li>
  <li>
    Productive
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For those with no hobbies, I suggest the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exercise
  </li>
  <li>
    Reading (internet, books)
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating (writing, building)
  </li>
  <li>
    Playing something with a clear goal and defined practice (chess, competitive video games)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sad_lux">MORE LUX: light bars for SAD</h2>

<p>
  Link: <a href="https://meaningness.com/sad-light-led-lux">MORE LUX: light bars for SAD</a>
</p>

<p>
  I think I suffer a bit from SAD. I get a bit melancholy in the winter months, and especially on days with overcast weather/little sunlight.
</p>

<p>
  The author brings up a valid point: purported lux means nothing if the distance is unaccounted for. But I doubt companies care or (most) consumers understand.
</p>

<p>
  I appreciate him taking the solution into his own hands by using light bars. A few friends have them on their trucks and holy cowâ€”they are bright! It seems a lot of times people think that "industrial-grade" objects can't be used in a personal-grade setting, when in fact they may be even better. (Never make the mistake of thinking that military-grade = better!) I don't have any examples off the top of my head, but I'm sure they're out there.

  While he never explicitly mentions that your eyes <i>must</i> be exposed, it is true. From <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seasonal-affective-disorder-bring-on-the-light-201212215663">Harvard Health Blog</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Bright light works by stimulating cells in the retina that connect to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that helps control circadian rhythms. Activating the hypothalamus at a certain time every day can restore a normal circadian rhythm and thus banish seasonal symptoms.
</blockquote>

<p>
  One commenter says:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Studies found that it is more beneficial to have the light enter your eyes from above your head. The light from the Day-Light Sky enters your eyes from ABOVE like the sun hits your eyes, in real life. It is important that the lamp projects 10,000 lux that light therapy professionals recommend for therapeutic use.
</blockquote>

<p>
  I am skeptical of this, but open to reading any paper regarding this.
</p>

<p>
  So far I have a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/general-electric-150w-a23-ultra-bright-aline-led-daylight/-/A-80131512#lnk=sametab">2610 lumen bulb</a> in my room (supplemented by a 1600 lumen one). I will look into the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WDFTHXB/?tag=meaningness-20">48,000 lumen stadium light</a> he recommends, but likely at a lower wattage/luminosity.
