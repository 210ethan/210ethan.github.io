<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>
  Comfort zone expansion (CoZE) was originally conceived by CFAR and is outlined extensively in <a href="https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf#page=121">their handbook</a>. Duncan Sabien has also <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ifa45nkAZiF5Msubi/comfort-zone-exploration">ported the chapter to LessWrong</a>.
</p>

<p>
  CoZE works by venturing outside of one's comfort zone in small increments, increasing the range by a bit each time. Consistent and deliberate practice over long periods will work, so long as each progression is "mastered" and there is deliberateness in going to the next progression.
</p>

<p>
  The CoZE algorithm is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Choose an experience that you'd like to explore
      <ul>
        <li>
          Something that's outside of the set of things you usually do
        </li>
        <li>
          Something you normally feel somewhat blocked from doing
        </li>
        <li>
          Something you think could be a positive or freeing or enjoyable new experience—something with a yum factor
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare to accept all worlds
      <ul>
        <li>
          Concretely visualize a future in which you still do not partake of this particular experience, and trust that if you choose this world, it's because you have good reasons not to
        </li>
        <li>
          Concretely visualize a future in which you feel free to partake of this particular experience, and trust that if you choose this world, it's because it's a world in which that's okay
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that both worlds feel comfortable and possible. If they don't, stop; you’re not properly oriented for CoZE.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Devise an experiment
      <ul>
        <li>
          Think of a small, safe way to engage with the experience—something that will allow you to "taste" it without locking you into anything or throwing you off-balance
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Actually try it
      <ul>
        <li>
          Check whether your experiment requires the help of other people or the creation of a special space
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay close attention to your internal experience—how are you reacting? What's going on with your body and your emotions?
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay close attention to external reality—what's happening, as a result? What are the consequences of your actions and experiences?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Digest the experience
      <ul>
        <li>
          Find a space to rest and relax, whether physical, mental, or both
        </li>
        <li>
          Notice your feelings, and compare them to your original model of what this experience would mean or be like
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide whether to continue/try again, or stop, taking extra care to ensure that you aren't forcing yourself into anything
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid overthinking—this is System 1's game, not System 2's
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<p>
  Exercises are focused on social interactions and split into easy, medium, and hard, with each section being very roughly sub-ordered (i.e., the easy section goes from very-easy to less-easy, but still not medium).
</p>

<p>
  Building both volume and diversity in an exercise can help to master it. Mastery is achieved when there is little to no hesitation performing the exercise.
</p>

<p>
  Some exercises are borrowed. Sources are linked accordingly.
