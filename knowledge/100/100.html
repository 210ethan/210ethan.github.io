<h1 id="100">100 Pieces of Advice</h1>

<p>
  After reading Jacob Falkovich's <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/">100 Ways To Live Better</a>, I was curious to see if I could do the same. While I'm generally not a fan of these types of lists because they tend to be gimmicky and shallow, some have definitely helped me and given me new perspectives. So here goes. Some may be similar to Jacob's, but I swear I thought of them on my own before I read his!

<ol>
  <li>
    Added sugar is easier to remove from your diet than you think. See <a href="../../training/sugar/sugar.html">Cutting Sugar</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order of importance for exercise (roughly, exceptions exist): consistency, volume, intensity.
  </li>
  <li>
    All you need are three exercises to get strong: overhead press, pull-up, and squat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pick a program and stick with it for at least 6-12 months. Do not fall victim to <a href="https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/">fuckarounditis</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Schwinn Airdyne is arguably the best piece of cardio equipment you can buy. Look on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and other local used goods sites.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nutrition is a major contributor to exercise success, both in quantity and quality. Eat enough and eat healthily.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mobility is often underrated and the new fad of "stretching bad" is not good. There is a time and place.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't drink calories. This includes coffee, tea, alcohol, soft drinks, juice, etc.
  </li>
</ol>



<h2 id="finance">Finance</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Unless you plan to drive a <i>lot</i>, buying a lightly used car is likely better.
  </li>
  <li>
    Buy Japanese cars. Their <a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/how-much-do-maintenance-costs-increase-by-mileage-by-maddy-martin">maintenance costs</a> are the lowest amount all car brands.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your company matches 401(k) contributions up to X%, contribute X%. It's free money.
  </li>
  <li>
    Index funds, specifically VTSAX and VTIAX, are all anyone <i>really</i> needs. About as diversified as you can get while still producing moderate returns (VTSAX is at 20% 1Y as of 02 February 2021).
  </li>
  <li>
    You are probably not smart enough to beat the market on your own. See the previous point.
  </li>
  <li>
    Money can easily be saved by looking for alternatives. Use the library, find coupons, go to free activities instead of expensive ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is worth looking into and possibly contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, i.e., IRAs and 401(k)s.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Being friends with your boss and boss' boss goes a long way.
  </li>
  <li>
    The biggest pay jumps happen inter-company, not intra-company.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switching between jobs too often looks bad on a resume and is often a red flag.
  </li>
  <li>
    Come prepared to an interview with questions for the interviewers.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="social">Social</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Be the one who makes plan with others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember things about people: likes, dislikes, hobbies, interests, etc.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
