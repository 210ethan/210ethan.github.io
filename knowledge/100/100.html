<h1 id="100">100 Pieces of Advice</h1>

<p>
  After reading Jacob Falkovich's <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better/">100 Ways To Live Better</a>, I was curious to see if I could do the same, but with more detail. While I'm generally not a fan of these types of lists because they tend to be gimmicky and shallow, some lists I've read have definitely helped me and given me new perspectives. So here goes. Some may be similar to Jacob's, but I swear I thought of them on my own before I read his!

<ol>
  <li>
    Added sugar is easier to minimize in a diet than most would think. See <a href="../../training/sugar/sugar.html">Cutting Sugar</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order of importance for exercise (roughly, exceptions exist): consistency, volume, intensity. If consistency isn't there, progress will be made and lost. If volume isn't adequate, muscles/CNS won't be stimulated enough. If the work isn't intense enough, the muscles and CNS aren't appropriately challenged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only three exercises are needed to get strong: overhead press, pull-up, and squat. OHP covers most pushing muscles and core. Pull-up covers pulling muscles and core if done right. Squat covers legs and core. If lack of weight access is a problem, read the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq">r/bodyweightfitness FAQ</a>, then get into the Recommended Routine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pick a program and stick with it for at least 6-12 months. Do not fall victim to <a href="https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/">fuckarounditis</a>. The <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/">r/Fitness wiki</a> is a great starting point for those unfamiliar with fitness.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Schwinn Airdyne is arguably the best piece of cardio equipment on the market. Look on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and other local used goods sites. They are incredibly durable, take up a small footprint (about 2 ft x 4 ft), and provide all the cardio possibly wanted or needed. Try to find one with the bigger fan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nutrition is a major contributor to exercise success, both in quantity and quality. Cutting overly-processed foods out should be the first priority. Quantity is dependent on goals, while quality is universal across athletes—nobody should be eating junk food. See <a href="https://www.nonprophet.media/jumptheshark">Jump the Shark</a> for details about nutrition.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mobility is often underrated and the new fad of "stretching bad" with a caveman voice is not good. At the same time, there is such a thing as too much mobility.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't drink calories. This includes some types of coffee, tea, alcohol, soft drinks, juice, etc. As expected, the calories come almost entirely from added sugar. The only liquids that should be drunk are water, unsweet tea, coffee (the allowable types are apparent), and milk (this one is a bit controversial).
  </li>
  <li>
    Filming oneself as both a self-form check and outsider form check can do wonders for seeing what is being done wrong. For example, my OHP was slighty uneven: my the left side of the barbell was always slightly higher than the right. After filming myself and looking in the mirror, I was able to notice a small difference in my arm positioning that caused the unevenness. Similarly, posting a video online for others to provide feedback is a good idea to get opinions from experts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sleep plays a major role in health, recovery, and general well-being. Following <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene">sleep hygiene</a> recommendations can improve life significantly without impacting it significantly.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="finance">Finance</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Unless planning to drive a <i>lot</i>, buying a certified used car is likely better than a brand new one. Much cheaper but with similar performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Buy Japanese-made cars. Their <a href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/how-much-do-maintenance-costs-increase-by-mileage-by-maddy-martin">maintenance costs</a> are the lowest amount all car brands. I've driven three Toyotas in my life: 1999 Tacoma, 2013 Camry, and 2015 Tacoma. None of them have ever had major problems and are still running smoothly in the 100,000 mi range. The other family Honda behaves just as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a company matches 401(k) contributions up to X%, contribute X%. It's free money.
  </li>
  <li>
    Index funds, specifically VTSAX and VTIAX, are all anyone <i>really</i> needs. About as diversified as they get while still producing moderate returns (VTSAX is at 20% 1Y as of 02 February 2021).
  </li>
  <li>
    Very few people are smart enough to beat the market on their own. See the previous point.
  </li>
  <li>
    Money can easily be saved by looking for alternatives. Use the library, find coupons, go to free activities instead of expensive ones.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is always worth looking into and possibly contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, i.e., IRAs and 401(k)s.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Being friends with the boss and boss' boss goes a long way. As the saying goes, "it's not what you know, it's who you know". While this has many exceptions (the candidate has know stuff to get a 3.X GPA to get the job), I know of many people who got jobs—in both public and private companies—because of connections they had on the inside. Being friends increases favorability, increasing the chances of future benefits (raises, promotions, etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    The biggest pay jumps happen inter-company, not intra-company. Loyalty generally doesn't pay.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switching between jobs too often looks bad on a resume and is often a red flag. There are exceptions to this, but I've heard this stated by managers across industry, and it's common sense. When somone can't keep a job for long, maybe it's not the job...
  </li>
  <li>
    Come prepared to an interview with questions for the interviewers. This proves a few things, depending on the depth and type of question. 1) Preparation for the interview. Surprisingly enough, this doesn't always happen... 2) Interest in the company and the want to learn more about its culture, history, future, etc. Some basic questions I've gathered over the years that I like:
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Can I clarify anything on my resume for you?" Shows thoughtfulness in case something wasn't understood and confidence that anything on the resume can be explained. Not being able to explain an entry is a major red flag.
      </li>
      <li>
        "When was the last time you took a vacation and where was it to?" Says a lot about the culture, people, or both.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Why is this position available?" This can reveal a lot about the company's culture. "The last guy quit because he was working too much" vs. "The last guy was rude to most team members" tells two completely different stories.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find ways to convey more productivity without visibly working more hours. This includes automating processes (see <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>), working extra hours with telling anybody (50 actual hours of work appears to be 40 hours of work), and embellishing your achievements (results may vary).
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="social">Social</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Be the one who makes plan with others. This conveys outgoingness and sociability. More invitations will come back than the person who sits around waiting for others to invite them. Before the age of COVID, I tried to extend one invitation per week to do something fun.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember things about people: likes, dislikes, hobbies, interests, etc. I mostly take mental notes, but the CLI tool <a href="https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends">friends</a> does an excellent job of keeping all notes and activities done with a specific friend in one place. I can simply type <code>friends list activities --with [friend]</code> and all activities with [friend] are printed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reading a lot about a lot (depth and breadth) gives more chances to relate with others, friends and strangers. Reading can include non-fiction and fiction books, articles, blog posts, current events, podcasts, magazines, and forums.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exposure to international cultures can provide new perspectives and experiences. Seek out those of different cultures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Having a solid group of only a few friends is much better than a shallow group of many friends.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never provide a timeline if it's unnecessary. If it's met, there is little good done, as the person who was provided it expected it to be. If it's not met, there is much bad done, as the person who was provided it expected it to be met, and pushing it back even more looks bad.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Learn to type quickly and without looking. Experiment with different keyboard layouts to see if it helps speed and comfort. 70-80 wpm is a good number to aim for.
  </li>
  <li>
    Experiment with multiple productivity systems to find which one or combination of multiple works best. I've found that taking principles from multiple and combining it into <a href="../productivity/productivity.html">my own system</a> is best. Everyone is individual, and there is no need to conform to a rigid system if it doesn't work well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn hotkeys. These save a significant amount of time and effort, and eventually become second nature to use. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">Mac hotkeys</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec">Windows hotkeys</a>. My most useful (for Mac) are: save, copy, paste, close window/tab, new tab, open last closed tab, go to address bar, select all, find in page, print, quit app, undo, redo, new.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get a <a href="../improvements/improvements.html#second_monitor">second monitor</a>.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Sleep in a dark, somewhat cool room with minimal sound. The dark can be achieved using blackout curtains and/or sleep mask; the cool by thermostat, fan, or open window, as well as breathable mattress and sheets; and the sound by earplugs/muffs or respectful neighbors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spend at least 15-30 minutes outside every day, more if it's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/">sunny</a>.
  </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="useful">Useful</h2>

<ol start="">
  <li>
    Purchase a set of four rechargeable AA and AAA batteries each. These pay for themselves after about 24 batteries or so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn to swim. It can literally mean life or death in some situations, and opens up an entirely different world. The time effort needed is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+long+to+lenar+to+swim&oq=how+long+to+lenar+to+swim&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13l2j0i13i30l4j0i22i30j0i390l2.3478j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">around 20 hr</a>, not an unreasonable time for such a useful skill.
  </li>
  <li>
    If someone says something really helped them and it's relatively low-cost to try, try it. It may work, but if it doesn't, there's no harm done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get two long phone charging cords, preferably at least 10 ft. There will be nowhere the cords can't reach. Also, if appropriate and applicable, two laptop chargers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learning how to cook has the advantage of making meals cheaper, tastier, and healthier and yourself more valuable. Mastering a few specific recipes is a relatively low-cost activity that pays big benefits. Mastering a cocktail recipe is a good idea, too.
  </li>
</ol>
