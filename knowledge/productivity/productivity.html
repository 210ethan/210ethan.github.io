<h1>Productivity</h1>

<p>
    Productivity boils down to the optimization and efficiency of time. The systems, applications, and methods used should attempt to minimize both time and effort spent doing monotonous or tedious tasks.
</p>

<h2 id="time_organization">Time Organization</h2>

<p>
  First, time needs to be organized properly. This means using a calendar app that can sync to both desktop and mobile devices: Google Calendar (GC, <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar">website</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Calendar">Wikipedia</a>), Microsoft Outlook (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook">website</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook">Wikipedia</a>), and Apple's Calendar (<a href="https://www.icloud.com/calendar">website</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(Apple)">Wikipedia</a>) are all well-known, popular choices.
</p>

<p>
  GC will be used as an example.
</p>

<p>
  Separate color-coded calendars can be used for each aspect of your life, e.g., social activities, course work, chores. This is helpful for a few reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The colors allow you to visually see where you are spending a majority of your time.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can better distinguish between events.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each individual calendar can be customized with notifications, sharing, and so on.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Here is what a typical calendar week looks like for me. (Slightly greyed-out as it was many months ago)
</p>

<p>
  While it looks like a lot, it really isn't too much. There are 12 calendars on the left, each with their own notification style:
</p>

<ul>
