<h1>Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS)</h1>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">LessWrong Spaced Repetition Wiki</a> provides all the information you can ever want or need about spaced repetition. Includes the science, blog posts, and various decks, among other items.
</p>

<h2 id="why_srs">Why Use SRS?</h2>

<p>
  You can remember virtually <i>anything</i> using SRS and with minimal effort. To put it in perspective, I've learned and remembered the following: all countries and their capitals, flags and locations; all elements and their symbols, atomic numbers, and atomic masses; poems. This is not a complete list.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last year, I've spent an average of 8.3 min/day studying those cards. Less than 10 min/day to learn all of that information. Of course, you can be more or less aggressive with the number of new cards introduced per day.
</p>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<p>
  Below you can find a list of suggestions for SRS:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<h2 id="alternating">Alternating Days</h2>

<p>
  I fell out of my daily Anki routine for some time, but seemed to notice that I got better results when I alternated review days. To test this, I spent three weeks with each method: every day vs. every other day.
