<h2 id="why_srs">Why Use SRS?</h2>

<p>
  You can remember virtually <i>anything</i> using SRS and with minimal effort. To put it in perspective, I've learned and remembered the following: all countries and their capitals, flags and locations; all elements and their symbols, atomic numbers, and atomic masses; poems. This is not a complete list.
</p>

<p>
  Over the last year, I've spent an average of 8.3 min/day studying those cards. Less than 10 min/day to learn all of that information. Of course, you can be more or less aggressive with the number of new cards introduced per day.
</p>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<p>
  Below you can find a list of suggestions for SRS:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Geography: Countries, country capitals, country flags; states, state capitals, state flags; mountains, mountain ranges; oceans, seas, rivers, lakes; regions
  </li>
  <li>
    Chemistry: Element symbols, element names, atomic numbers, atomic masses; group names; bonds, molecular structures
  </li>
  <li>
    Poems
  </li>
  <li>
    Quotes
  </li>
  <li>
    Laws/Rules/Razors: Murphy, Goodhart, Occam's, Hanlon's, Dunning-Kruger, Finagle's, Hitchen's, Alder's, Chekhov's gun
  </li>
  <li>
    History: Seven ancient wonders, seven new wonders, seven deadly sins, important dates, famous artwork
  </li>
  <li>
    Acronyms: Laser, QED, DOI,
  </li>
  <li>
    Miscellaneous: Roll/yaw/pitch, type I/II errors, SI units, port vs. starboard, NATO alphabet, life of universe,
  </li>
  <li>
    Constants: Electron rest mass, pi, e, Planck's constant, G, g, SI-prefixes, speed of light, fundamental charge, Boltzmann constant, Avogadro's number
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal numbers: Phone (personal, friends, family, coworkers), credit card, licenses, accounts, passwords
  </li>
  <li>
    Relationships: Birthdays, likes, dislikes
  </li>
  <li>
    Languages: Vocabulary, sentences, pronunciation, minimal pairs
  </li>
  <li>
    Equations: Physics, engineering, mathematics
  </li>
  <li>
    Forgettables: Things you often forget or misremember.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fallacies: [to be completed]
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  And the list can go on. The point is you can learn and remember <i>anything</i> with minimal effort using spaced-repetition.
