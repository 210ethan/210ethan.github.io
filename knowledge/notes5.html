<p>
  The notes below are designed for ease-of-input, i.e., I want there to be little in the way of entering them besides links and quotes. Will I reference them later? I don't know. Can I reference them later? Yes.

  From Gwern's notes on <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/iq/1935-wechsler-rangeofhumancapacities.pdf">Range of Human Capacities</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Wechsler found that the ratio of the smallest to biggest, or best to worst, in just about any measure of humanity, from high jumping to hosiery looping [knitting], was between 2 to one and 3 to one. To Wechsler, the ratio appeared so consistent that he suggested it as a kind of universal rule of thumb.

<blockquote>
  combed the world’s skill-acquisition studies in an effort to determine whether practice makes equal, and his conclusion is that it depends on the task. In simple tasks, practice brings people closer together, but in complex ones, it often pulls them apart. Ackerman has designed computer simulations used to test air traffic controllers, and he says that people converge on a similar skill level with practice on the easy tasks—like clicking buttons to get planes to take off in order—but for the more complex simulations that are used for real-life controllers, “the individual differences go up”, he says, not down, with practice. In other words, there’s a Matthew effect on skill acquisition.
