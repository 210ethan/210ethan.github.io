<h1>Questions</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to post answers to questions that I think of. Questions in bold.

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>What makes some materials more flammable than others?</b> From <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/87322/why-are-some-materials-more-flammable-than-others">chemistry.stackexchange</a>: "for a material to be flammable it needs to contain something that is oxidizable by air oxygen, typically carbon ... The more volatile a material is, the more flammable it will be." Volatility is determined by the material's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)#Intermolecular_forces">intermolecular forces</a>.

    <b>What determines blood types?</b> The four major blood groups—A, B, O, AB—each have a protein, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_factor">Rh factor</a>, that is either present or absent. This creates 8 blood types: A+, A-, ..., AB-. The A and B refer to specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen">antigen</a>. The letter refers to the present antigen, while the opposite letter's antibody is present. For example, type A+ has an A antigen, B antibody, and present Rh factor. Group O has neither antigens but both antibodies. Universal red cell donor is O- and universal plasma donor is AB (+ or -). Source <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html">here</a>.

    <b>How are future populations determined?</b> From the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj/about.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a>: "population projections are based on the most recent decennial census and using the cohort-component method (see bottom of link for definition). Assumptions about future births, deaths, net international migration, and domestic migration" are also used. Multiple projections may also be used, where each projection falls into a range based on the assumptions' ranges. This <a href="https://assets.prb.org/pdf14/understanding-population-projections.pdf">paper</a> describes the major assumptions (fertility, mortality, migration) used in creating populatio projections.

    <b>What determines the seasonality of a virus?</b> The truth is we don't entirely know. Some diseases increase in the summer, others in the winter. Knowing the functions behind the seasonality will help us combat future viruses.
