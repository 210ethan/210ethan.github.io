<h1 id="problems">Year Review</h1>

<p>
  At the end of every year, I reflect on how it went. Given that I am a big fan of <a href="../productivity/productivity.html#reviewing_productivity">reviews</a> and <a href="../productivity/productivity.html#todo_list">journaling</a>, this is no surprise.
</p>

<p>
  This review helps in a few ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tracks progress on various things over the course of many years.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows me to look back on where I was and what I did in Year 20XX.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below is everything that I go over in my year review, with full descriptions further down.

<h2 id="philosophies">Philosophies</h2>

<p>
  My life philosophies tend to be volatile. One year I think this, the next I think that, the next the complete opposite, and so on. Documenting these helps me see how my reasoning and thinking has changed over the years.
</p>

<p>
  A few examples of past life philosophies and questions I've noted down:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    What is the best work-life balance for me?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the most important things in life?
  </li>
  <li>
    Should I maintain friendships that are primarily one-sided (I am the only one reaching out)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do I want a wife? If so, do I want children?
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>

<p>
  Included in this category are articles, essays, videos, movies, television shows, music, pictures (personal and not).
