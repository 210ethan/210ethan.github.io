<h1 id="problems">Year Review</h1>

<p>
  At the end of every year, I reflect on how it went. Given that I am a big fan of <a href="../productivity/productivity.html#reviewing_productivity">reviews</a> and <a href="../productivity/productivity.html#todo_list">journaling</a>, this is no surprise.
</p>

<p>
  This review helps in a few ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tracks progress on various things over the course of many years.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows me to look back on where I was and what I did in Year 20XX.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Below is everything that I go over in my year review, with full descriptions further down.

<h2 id="philosophies">Philosophies</h2>

<p>
  My life philosophies tend to be volatile. One year I think this, the next I think that, the next the complete opposite, and so on. Documenting these helps me see how my reasoning and thinking has changed over the years.
</p>

<p>
  A few examples of past life philosophies and questions I've noted down:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    What is the best work-life balance for me?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the most important things in life?
  </li>
  <li>
    Should I maintain friendships that are primarily one-sided (I am the only one reaching out)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do I want a wife? If so, do I want children?
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>

<p>
  Included in this category are articles, essays, videos, movies, television shows, music, pictures (personal and not).
</p>

<p>
  This reminds me of my interests at the time and provides a sense of nostalgia. I review all of these in their entirety.
</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>
  Goals should be as <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">SMART</a> as possible for obvious reasons. SMART goals provide a sense of progress (which can serve as both a motivator and demotivator, depending on the progress made) and an objective measure of when they have been achieved.
</p>

<p>
  Two types of goals are listed: annual (to be completed by 31 December) and time-periodic (e.g., X by 01 June).
</p>

<p>
  Example categories include the following, where the letters can be numbers or specific items related to the noun that follows, e.g., learn 5 skills or learn how to shuffle cards and suture a wound.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Training (exercise): Lift A weight, run/row/ride B time, complete C reps, complete D race, lose E lb/kg
  </li>
  <li>
    Professional: Get A raise/promotion, complete B project(s), achieve C revenue, submit D pull requests
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal: Volunteer B hours, write C blog posts, travel D places
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial: Save $A, contribute $B to retirement accounts, follow $C budget, eliminate $D debt, establish $E emergency fund
  </li>
  <li>
    Relationships: Maintain A friendships, meet B new people, have C date nights
  </li>
  <li>
    Education: Complete A classes (online, in-person), read B books, learn C skills
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> to track my computer usage and Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">Screen Time</a> for tracking my phone usage.
</p>

<p>
  Other statistics include hours slept, bodyweight over time, time spent exercising, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/">Spotify's Wrapped</a>.
