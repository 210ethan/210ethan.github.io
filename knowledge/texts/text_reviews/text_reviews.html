<h2 id="tradecraft_primer">Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques for Improving Intelligence Analysis</h2>

<p>
  From the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
  This primer highlights structured analytic techniques—some widely used in the private sector and academia, some unique to the intelligence profession...the primer highlights how structured analytic techniques can help one challenge judgments, identify mental mindsets, stimulate creativity, and manage uncertainty. In short, incorporating regular use of techniques such as these can enable one to structure thinking for wrestling with difficult questions.

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  First, the "relevant and diagnostic information" must be sorted out of the heap of total information, including information that is placed there to mislead. Once the pertinent information has been collected, a "systematic approach that considers a range of alternative explanations and outcomes" can be applied to examine the problem from a holistic standpoint, such that "potentially relevant hypotheses and supporting information" are all examined.
</p>

<p>
  When analyzing the information, bias are guaranteed to appear, but care should be taken to recognize and mitigate the risk they pose to the analysis. Examples of biases below:

</p>

<p>
  <b>1941 World War II</b>: Japan would avoid all-out war because it recognized US military superiority
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Given that US superiority would only increase, Japan might view a first strike as the only way to knock America out of the war.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1950s Korean War</b>: China would not cross the Yalu River in support of the North Korean government.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Red China could make good on its threats to counter “US aggression” against the North.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1962 Cuban Missile Crisis</b>: The Soviet Union would not introduce offensive nuclear weapons into Cuba.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">The Kremlin could miscalculate and believe it could create a fait accompli that a young US President would not be prepared to reverse.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1973 Yom Kippur War</b>: Arabs knew they could not win because they had failed to cooperate in the past and still lacked sufficient air defenses to counter Israeli airpower.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">A surprise Arab attack, even if repelled, could wound Israel psychologically and prompt international calls for cease-fires and diplomatic negotiations.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1989 German Unification</b>: East Germany could not unify with the West Germany against the wishes of the Soviet Union.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">The Soviet Union—under Gorbachev—might not be prepared to intervene militarily in Eastern Europe as it had in the past.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1998 Indian Nuclear Test</b>: Conducting a nuclear test risked international condemnation and US sanctions and would threaten a newly elected coalition government.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">A successful and surprise nuclear test could boost Indian nationalist pride and solidify public support for a shaky coalition government.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>2003 Iraq's WMD Programs</b>: Saddam failed to cooperate with UN inspectors because he was continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">If Iraqi authorities had destroyed their WMD stocks and abandoned their programs, they might refuse to fully acknowledge this to the UN to maintain Iraq’s regional status, deterrence, and internal regime stability. .</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These situations are viewed from a U.S. perspective, and seem to fail to take into account foreign cultures contributing to behavior and perceived miscalculations. A few non-national-security-related, trivial examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="https://www.englishspectrum.com/differences-in-work-ethics-between-korea-and-the-west/">difference in work cultures between Korea and the West</a> are stark: Koreans live to work, Americans work to live; seniority is much more important in Korea, whereas having a younger superior in the U.S. is not abnormal; working hard is expected in Korea, but optional in the U.S. (only if you want to succeed at your position).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=smiling+in+russia&oq=smiling+in+russia&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.2913j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Russians are known not to smile often</a>, yet Americans <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/why-americans-smile-so-much/524967/">smile <i>a lot</i></a>—at strangers, cameras, etc. Lack of smiling in Russia is not because they are unhappy or unfriendly, but because they use it mostly to signal happiness, not as a social cue to convey friendliness. Americans use it both to signal happiness and as a social cue.
  </li>
  <li>
    (My only source for this example is Douglas Laux's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663872-left-of-boom"><i>Left of Boom</i></a>. I have tried searching elsewhere for examples but everything comes up contrary to Laux's claims). Laux claims that Afghans are very willing to be dishonest or sell out their peers to make money, a trait the U.S. took advantage of during our time in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban (sadly, still ongoing). In the U.S., honesty is hailed as a virtuous trait and anyone caught lying is chastised for doing so. While a large amount of Americans do consider the possibility of their being lied to for the liar's benefit, some are naive and take information at face value without considering the intentions of the other party. In Afghanistan, Laux took all information with a hefty grain of salt for that reason: the Afghans would say virtually anything to get paid, true or not.

</ul>

<p>
  When interacting with people from a different culture and they act in a different and/or offensive manner not consistent with the location's norms, consider the culture as the cause, not malice. This can be thought of as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's razor</a>, where stupidity is replaced by ignorance ("never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance").

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_how_to_use">How to Use</h3>

<blockquote>
  The analytic techniques in this primer are designed to help individual analysts, as well as teams, explore and challenge their analytical arguments and mindsets. ... All the techniques are included because they have helped other analysts avoid rigid ways of thinking or assisted them in exploring new outcomes or implications of an intelligence problem. ... The techniques are grouped by their purpose: diagnostic techniques are primarily aimed at making analytic arguments, assumptions, or intelligence gaps more transparent; contrarian techniques explicitly challenge current thinking; and imaginative thinking techniques aim at developing new insights, different perspectives and/or develop alternative outcomes.

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques">Diagnostic Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques_key_assumptions">Key Assumptions Check</h4>

<p>
  Key assumptions should be analyzed at the beginning of a project and consist of "any hypothesis that analysts have accepted to be true and which forms the basis of the assessment". These are often looked at as obvious, but can include small intricacies that can render the entire assumption null and/or point to a better assumption, resulting in an oversight being dangerous to the entire project. For example, "when economists assess the prospects for foreign economic reforms, they may consciously, or not, assume a degree of political stability in those countries or the region that may or may not exist in the future". What happens when a massive regime change occurs and the economic and political environment is thrown into turmoil? The projections should have a multitude of outcomes that account for each plausible scenario.
</p>

<p>
  Checking key assumptions helps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Explain the logic of the analytic argument and expose faulty logic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the key factors that shape an issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stimulate thinking about an issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Uncover hidden relationships and links between key factors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify developments that would cause you to abandon an assumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare analysts for changed circumstances that could surprise them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These benefits are not just for that one specific project, but also ongoing and future projects: honing these skills allow better checks to be made in the future. Some situations are quite similar to one another, and using the same line of thinking from project A may be applicable—directly or indirectly—to project B.
</p>

<p>
  A four-step process is used to evaluate key assumptions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Review what the current analytic line on this issue appears to be; write it down for all to see.
  </li>
  <li>
    Articulate all the premises, both stated and unstated in finished intelligence, which are accepted as true for this analytic line to be valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Challenge each assumption, asking why it “must” be true and whether it remains valid under all conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refine the list of key assumptions to contain only those that “must be true” to sustain your analytic line; consider under what conditions or in the face of what information these assumptions might not hold.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Questions to ask during this four-step process include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How much confidence exists that this assumption is correct?
  </li>
  <li>
    What explains the degree of confidence in the assumption?
  </li>
  <li>
    What circumstances or information might undermine this assumption?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is a key assumption more likely a key uncertainty or key factor?
  </li>
  <li>
    Could the assumption have been true in the past but less so now?
  </li>
  <li>
    If the assumption proves to be wrong, would it significantly alter the analytic line? How?
  </li>
  <li>
    Has this process identified new factors that need further analysis?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Of course, an analysis is a work-in-progress and only complete when the deadline passes or the analyzed content is no longer relevant. As new information is processed and assumptions made, they should be put through the same rigorous checking as the original ones.
