<h1>Text Reviews</h1>

<p>
  This is a place for me to take notes and review longer texts that are posted in the <a href="../../../links.html">Links</a> page. The contents are a mix of copy-and-pasted text from the source, as well as my own thoughts. I do not distinguish between the two. See the original source text for what is direct and what I wrote myself.
</p>

<p>
  Blockquotes are essentiall direct quotes. For example, if the quote says "In our lives, we are constantly ...", I will shorten it to "We are constantly ...". No information is lost, but the note is shorter. Anything in square brackets [like this] is my personal note.

</p>

<p>
  Background: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_de_Becker">Gavin de Becker</a> is considered one of the world's leading security specialists, focusing on government and high-profile figures, e.g., Jeff Bezos.
</p>

<blockquote>
  [Violence statistics presented are meant] to increase the likelihood that you will believe it is at least possible that you or someone you care for will be a victim at some time. That belief is a key element in recognizing when you are in the presence of danger.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The human violence we abhor and fear the most, that which we call "random" and "senseless", is neither. It always has purpose and meaning to the perpetrator.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  ...intuition is soaring flight compared to the plodding of logic. The human brain is never more efficient or invested than when its host is at risk.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  We tend to give our full attention to risks that are beyond our control while ignoring those that we feel in charge of, even though the latter are far more likely to harm us.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  We are constantly bombarded with kangaroo signals [false information that is purported to be true] masquerading as knowledge, and our intuition relies on us to decide what we will give credence to.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "I don't believe in such a thing as the criminal mind. Everyone's mind is criminal; we're all capable of criminal fantasies and thoughts." [This should also include actions.]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The stakes of some predictions require that I intimately recognize and accept what I observe in others no matter who they are, no matter what they have done, no matter what they might do, no matter where it takes me in myself.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Acts of extraordinary violence happen, and we cannot learn why they happen by looking at rare behavior as if it is something outsides ourselves. That idea you just conjured was in you, and thus it is part of us. To really work toward prediction and prevention, we must accept that these acts are done by people included in the "we" of humanity [as opposed to "them"].
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  One thing that does predict violent criminality is violence in one's childhood. Research confirmed that 100 percent of serial killers had been abused as children with violence, neglect, or humiliation.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Recklessness and bravado are features of many violent people.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Seeing a vision of the future better than most people because the present is not distracting is a characteristic common to many criminals. You can spot this in people who do not react as you might to shocking things.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The need to be in control is another characteristic common to predatory criminals.

  These notes are from pages 1-55. I stopped after that out of boredom (not bored of the book, but bored of entering all these notes, as I forgot to make important passages with a pen).

</p>

<blockquote>
  In reality, long-term travel has nothing to do with demographics—age, ideology, income—and everything to do with personal outlook...it's about being a student of daily life...Vagabonding is about looking for adventure in normal life, and normal life within adventure. Vagabonding is an attitude—a friendly interest in people, places, and things that makes a person an explorer in the truest, most vivid sense of the word.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Most of us have never taken such vows [saying you'll travel in the future], but we choose to live like monks anyway, rooting ourselves to a home or a career and using the future as a kind of phony ritual that justifies the present.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  As citizens of a stable, prosperous democracy, any one of us has the power to create our <i>own</i> free time, outside the whims of federal laws and private-sector policies. Indeed, if the clock appears to move faster than it did in sixth grade, it's only because we haven't actualized our power as adults to set our own recess schedule.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The act of quitting [a job or career] "means not giving up, but moving on; changing direction not because something doesn't agree with you, but because you don't agree with something. It's not a complaint, but a positive choice, and not a stop in one's journey, but a step in a better direction. Quitting means taking a turn so as to be sure you're still moving in the direction of your dreams."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The notion that material is somehow more important to life than personal investment is exactly what leads so many of us to believe we could never afford to go vagabonding.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  On a basic level, there are three general methods to simplifying your life: stopping expansion [don't add any new items to your life], reining in your routine [start living more humbly, e.g., cook meals instead of eating out, do free activities instead of paid ones, etc.], and reducing clutter [downsizing current inventory].
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "Preparation no more spoils the chance for spontaneity and serendipity than discipline ruins the opportunity for genuine self-expression in sports, acting, or the tea ceremony...The goal of preparation is not knowing exactly where you'll go but being confident nonetheless that you'll get there."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  As a general rule, good guidebooks Contain useful, condensed travel information relating to a specific region: historical and cultural background; pointers regarding local languages in customs; data on the climate and environment; advice and getting visas and changing money; tips for staying healthy and out of harm's way; instructions for using local transportation; and recommendations for lodging, food, and entertainment.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The value of your travels does not hinge on how many stamps you have in your passport when you get home—and the slow, nuanced experience of a single country is always better than the hurried, superficial experience of forty countries.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Find a partner who exudes an attitude of realism and open-mindedness; these are the virtues you yourself will want to cultivate.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  [Bring on your travels] as little as possible... a guidebook; a pair of sandals; standard hygiene items; relevant medicines; earplugs; small gift items; simple, function clothes and one nice outfit for customs checks and social occasions; pocketknife; flashlight; sunglasses; day pack; camera; boots or walking shoes; padlock.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The secret to staying intrigued on the road—the  secret to truly being different from the frustrated masses—is this: Don't set limits. Don't set limits on what you can or can't do. Don't set limits on what is or sin't worthy of your time. Dare yourself to "play games" with your day: watch, wait, listen; allow things to happen.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  The secret of adventure is not to carefully seek it out but to travel in such a way that it finds you.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Learn to treasure your worst experiences as gripping new chapters in the epic novel that is your life. "Adventurous men enjoy shipwrecks, mutinies, earthquakes, conflagrations, and all kinds of unpleasant experiences,"" wrote Bertrand Russell. "'So this is what an earthquake feels like', and it gives them pleasure to have their knowledge of the world increased by this new item."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Wherever you go, a few basic precautions will apply. Avoid bringing expensive or irreplaceable, and don't flaunt what wealth you do have. Keep cash and traveler's checks in discreet places, and be wary of public distractions or dense crowds. Keep extra cash in safe. In tourist areas, be wary of new "friends".

<blockquote>
  This primer highlights structured analytic techniques—some widely used in the private sector and academia, some unique to the intelligence profession...the primer highlights how structured analytic techniques can help one challenge judgments, identify mental mindsets, stimulate creativity, and manage uncertainty. In short, incorporating regular use of techniques such as these can enable one to structure thinking for wrestling with difficult questions.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  First, the "relevant and diagnostic information" must be sorted out of the heap of total information, including information that is placed there to mislead. Once the pertinent information has been collected, a "systematic approach that considers a range of alternative explanations and outcomes" can be applied to examine the problem from a holistic standpoint, such that "potentially relevant hypotheses and supporting information" are all examined.
</p>

<p>
  When analyzing the information, bias are guaranteed to appear, but care should be taken to recognize and mitigate the risk they pose to the analysis. Examples of biases below:
</p>

  Examples of "strategic assumptions that were not challenged" are provided. Questions in bold, answers in bullet points (the last five have spoilers to allow the reader to consider the answer before reading it).
</p>

<p>
  <b>1941 World War II</b>: Japan would avoid all-out war because it recognized US military superiority
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Given that US superiority would only increase, Japan might view a first strike as the only way to knock America out of the war.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1950s Korean War</b>: China would not cross the Yalu River in support of the North Korean government.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Red China could make good on its threats to counter “US aggression” against the North.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1962 Cuban Missile Crisis</b>: The Soviet Union would not introduce offensive nuclear weapons into Cuba.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">The Kremlin could miscalculate and believe it could create a fait accompli that a young US President would not be prepared to reverse.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1973 Yom Kippur War</b>: Arabs knew they could not win because they had failed to cooperate in the past and still lacked sufficient air defenses to counter Israeli airpower.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">A surprise Arab attack, even if repelled, could wound Israel psychologically and prompt international calls for cease-fires and diplomatic negotiations.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1989 German Unification</b>: East Germany could not unify with the West Germany against the wishes of the Soviet Union.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">The Soviet Union—under Gorbachev—might not be prepared to intervene militarily in Eastern Europe as it had in the past.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>1998 Indian Nuclear Test</b>: Conducting a nuclear test risked international condemnation and US sanctions and would threaten a newly elected coalition government.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">A successful and surprise nuclear test could boost Indian nationalist pride and solidify public support for a shaky coalition government.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>2003 Iraq's WMD Programs</b>: Saddam failed to cooperate with UN inspectors because he was continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="spoiler">If Iraqi authorities had destroyed their WMD stocks and abandoned their programs, they might refuse to fully acknowledge this to the UN to maintain Iraq’s regional status, deterrence, and internal regime stability. .</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These situations are viewed from a U.S. perspective, and seem to fail to take into account foreign cultures contributing to behavior and perceived miscalculations. A few not-directly-related-to-national-security examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="https://www.englishspectrum.com/differences-in-work-ethics-between-korea-and-the-west/">difference in work cultures between Korea and the West</a> are stark: Koreans live to work, Americans work to live; seniority is much more important in Korea, whereas having a younger superior in the U.S. is not abnormal; working hard is expected in Korea, but optional in the U.S. (only if you want to succeed at your position).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=smiling+in+russia&oq=smiling+in+russia&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.2913j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Russians are known not to smile often</a>, yet Americans <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/why-americans-smile-so-much/524967/">smile <i>a lot</i></a>—at strangers, cameras, etc. Lack of smiling in Russia is not because they are unhappy or unfriendly, but because they use it mostly to signal happiness, not as a social cue to convey friendliness. Americans use it both to signal happiness and as a social cue.
  </li>
  <li>
    (My only source for this example is Douglas Laux's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663872-left-of-boom"><i>Left of Boom</i></a>. I have tried searching elsewhere for examples but everything comes up contrary to Laux's claims). Laux claims that Afghans are very willing to be dishonest or sell out their peers to make money, a trait the U.S. took advantage of during our time in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban (sadly, still ongoing). In the U.S., honesty is hailed as a virtuous trait and anyone caught lying is chastised for doing so. While a large amount of Americans do consider the possibility of their being lied to for the liar's benefit, some are naive and take information at face value without considering the intentions of the other party. In Afghanistan, Laux took all information with a hefty grain of salt for that reason: the Afghans would say virtually anything to get paid, true or not.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When interacting with people from a different culture and they act in a different and/or offensive manner not consistent with the location's norms, consider the culture as the cause, not malice. This can be thought of as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's razor</a>, where stupidity is replaced by ignorance ("never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance").
</p>

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_how_to_use">How to Use</h3>

<blockquote>
  The analytic techniques in this primer are designed to help individual analysts, as well as teams, explore and challenge their analytical arguments and mindsets. ... All the techniques are included because they have helped other analysts avoid rigid ways of thinking or assisted them in exploring new outcomes or implications of an intelligence problem. ... The techniques are grouped by their purpose: diagnostic techniques are primarily aimed at making analytic arguments, assumptions, or intelligence gaps more transparent; contrarian techniques explicitly challenge current thinking; and imaginative thinking techniques aim at developing new insights, different perspectives and/or develop alternative outcomes.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques">Diagnostic Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques_key_assumptions">Key Assumptions Check</h4>

<p>
  Key assumptions should be analyzed at the beginning of a project and consist of "any hypothesis that analysts have accepted to be true and which forms the basis of the assessment". These are often looked at as obvious, but can include small intricacies that can render the entire assumption null and/or point to a better assumption, resulting in an oversight being dangerous to the entire project. For example, "when economists assess the prospects for foreign economic reforms, they may consciously, or not, assume a degree of political stability in those countries or the region that may or may not exist in the future". What happens when a massive regime change occurs and the economic and political environment is thrown into turmoil? The projections should have a multitude of outcomes that account for each plausible scenario.
</p>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Explain the logic of the analytic argument and expose faulty logic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the key factors that shape an issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stimulate thinking about an issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Uncover hidden relationships and links between key factors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify developments that would cause you to abandon an assumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare analysts for changed circumstances that could surprise them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These benefits are not just for that one specific project, but also ongoing and future projects: honing these skills allow better checks to be made in the future. Some situations are quite similar to one another, and using the same line of thinking from project A may be applicable—directly or indirectly—to project B.
</p>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Review what the current analytic line on this issue appears to be; write it down for all to see.
  </li>
  <li>
    Articulate all the premises, both stated and unstated in finished intelligence, which are accepted as true for this analytic line to be valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Challenge each assumption, asking why it “must” be true and whether it remains valid under all conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refine the list of key assumptions to contain only those that “must be true” to sustain your analytic line; consider under what conditions or in the face of what information these assumptions might not hold.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Questions to ask during the process:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How much confidence exists that this assumption is correct?
  </li>
  <li>
    What explains the degree of confidence in the assumption?
  </li>
  <li>
    What circumstances or information might undermine this assumption?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is a key assumption more likely a key uncertainty or key factor?
  </li>
  <li>
    Could the assumption have been true in the past but less so now?
  </li>
  <li>
    If the assumption proves to be wrong, would it significantly alter the analytic line? How?
  </li>
  <li>
    Has this process identified new factors that need further analysis?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Of course, an analysis is a work-in-progress and only complete when the deadline passes or the analyzed content is no longer relevant. As new information is processed and assumptions made, they should be put through the same rigorous checking as the original ones.
</p>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques_quality_info_check">Quality of Information Check</h4>

<p>
  Quality of information should be prioritized over quantity. Given 10 dubious pieces of information vs. 2 veracious pieces of information, the latter is to be preferred. Of course the former should be analyzed, but the higher-quality information should be given priority in the analysis process.
</p>

<p>
  How to go about checking the quality? A few ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Review quality from previous information that came from the same source. If the past information has been excellent, it is likely future information will continue to be correct. Vice versa for poor information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare similar information (this document vs. that document). Any discrepancies can be examined further.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    It can help to detect possible deception and denial strategies by an adversary.
  </li>
  <li>
    It can identify key intelligence gaps and new requirements for collectors.
  </li>
  <li>
    It can assist policymakers in understanding how much confidence analysts are placing on analytic judgments.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The method generally involves using a database, which is a good method to both store and review information. It allows for quick and easy access, notes, and virtually-unlimited storage. From there, analysts can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Review systematically all sources for accuracy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify information sources that appear most critical or compelling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check for sufficient and strong corroboration of critical reporting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reexamine previously dismissed information in light of new facts or circumstances that cast it in a different light.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that any recalled reporting is identified and properly flagged for other analysts; analysis based on recalled reporting should also be reviewed to determine if the reporting was essential to the judgments made.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider whether ambiguous information has been interpreted and caveated properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Indicate a level of confidence that analysts can place in sources, which are likely to figure in future analytic assessments.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques_indicators_change">Indicators of Change</h4>

<p>
  Some events may indicate major change is coming, e.g., democratic protests in a non-democratic country (while the government is unlikely to change, this is nonetheless an essentially-required step towards democratization). "The technique can be used whenever an analyst needs to track an event over time to monitor and evaluate changes."
</p>

<blockquote>
  By laying out a list of critical variables, analysts also will be generating hypotheses regarding why they expect to see the presence of such factors. In so doing, analysts make the analytic line much more transparent and available for scrutiny by others.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Identify a set of competing hypotheses or scenarios.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create separate lists of potential activities, statements, or events expected for each hypothesis or scenario.
  </li>
  <li>
    Regularly review and update the indicators lists to see which are changing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the most likely or most correct hypotheses or scenarios, based on the number of changed indicators that are observed.
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  Developing two lists of indicators for each hypothesis or scenario may prove useful to distinguish between indicators that a development is or is not emerging. This is particularly useful in a “What If?” Analysis, when it is important to make a case that a certain event is unlikely to happen.
</blockquote>

<img src="media/govt_indicators.png" alt="govt_indicators" width="200" class="center">

<p>
  Some indicators that aren't labeled as a concern are surprising. Take "Insurgent/separatist/terrorist group activity". Is this not a major issue for the instability in Afghanistan and Iraq? Others seem surprising at first glance, but don't hold up after examination. "Food/energy shortages" occur all the time in North Korea, yet the regime still holds strong.
</p>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_diagnostic_techniques_competing_hypotheses">Analysis of Competing Hypotheses</h4>

<p>
  When sorting through and evaluating large amounts of data with a team, there are bound to be multiple hypotheses formed. It is important to compare and contrast the hypotheses and what evidence is being used to support them. If agreement is unanimous, the hypothesis is more likely to be strong; if there is disagreement, the specific aspects can be discussed and resolved to one or combined to form a hybrid hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
  There are a few reasons to analyze competing hypothesis:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Analysts often are susceptible to being unduly influenced by a first impression, based on incomplete data, an existing analytic line, or a single explanation that seems to fit well enough.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analysts seldom generate a full set of explanations or hypotheses at the outset of a project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analysts often rely on evidence to support their preferred hypothesis, but which also is consistent with other explanations.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In order to avoid focusing on one hypothesis or giving too much preference to certain information, everything should be examined equally and preference only applied once all information has been processed. Even if some information seems irrelevant and/or false, it should still be considered, as it may turn out to be relevant and/or true.
</p>

<p>
  The process consists of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Brainstorm among analysts with different perspectives to identify all possible hypotheses.
  </li>
  <li>
    List all significant evidence and arguments relevant to all the hypotheses.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and each piece of evidence on the side. Determine whether each piece of evidence is consistent, inconsistent, or not applicable to each hypothesis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refine the matrix and reconsider the hypotheses—in some cases, analysts will need to add new hypotheses and re-examine the information available.
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on disproving hypotheses rather than proving one. Talley the pieces of evidence that are inconsistent and consistent with each hypothesis to see which explanations are the weakest and strongest.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyze how sensitive the ACH results are to a few critical items of evidence; should those pieces prove to be wrong, misleading, or subject to deception, how would it impact an explanation’s validity?
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask what evidence is not being seen but would be expected for a given hypothesis to be true. Is denial and deception a possibility?
  </li>
  <li>
    Report all the conclusions, including the weaker hypotheses that should still be monitored as new information becomes available.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish the relative likelihood for the hypotheses and report all the conclusions, including the weaker hypotheses that should still be monitored as new information becomes available.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify and monitor indicators that would be both consistent and inconsistent with the full set of hypotheses. In the latter case, explore what could account for inconsistent data.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These steps allow for a holistic process of elimination and review for all hypotheses and supporting evidence.
</p>

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_contrarian_techniques">Contrarian Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_contrarian_techniques_devils_advocacy">Devil's Advocacy</h4>

<p>
  Despite a strong hypothesis and supporting evidence, there can still be flaws in assumptions or evidence. A Devil's Advocate approach should be used: simply try to find anything and everything wrong and/or weak with the hypothesis or supporting assumptions. Using DA in conjunction with the <a href="https://koenfucius.wordpress.com/2019/10/11/the-devils-advocate-and-the-steel-man/">steel man</a> can make for robust analyses. Even if nothing weak nor false is found, it still proves the original analysis was strong. If flaws are found, it allows those to be fixed.
</p>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Explicitly challenging key assumptions to see if they will not hold up under some circumstances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identifying any faulty logic or information that would undermine the key analytic judgments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Presenting alternative hypotheses that would explain the current body of information available to analysts.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Outline the mainline judgment and key assumptions and characterize the evidence supporting that current analytic view.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select one or more assumptions—stated or not—that appear the most susceptible to challenge. [Selecting assumptions makes for a more robust, yet time-consuming, analysis. This should be done for critical projects.]
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the information used to determine whether any is of questionable validity, whether deception is possibly indicated, or whether major gaps exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Highlight the evidence that could support an alternative hypothesis or contradicts the current thinking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Present to the group the findings that demonstrate there are flawed assumptions, poor quality evidence, or possible deception at work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider drafting a separate contrarian paper that lays out the arguments for a different analytic conclusion if the review uncovers major analytic flaws.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be sure that any products generated clearly lay out the conventional wisdom and are identified as an explicitly “Devil’s Advocate” project; otherwise, the reader can become confused as to the current official view on the issue.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_contrarian_techniques_team_ab">Team A/Team B</h4>

<p>
  Team A/Team B (TAB) is similar to Devil's Advocacy, but not identical. In Team A/Team B, each time takes sides of two strong, competing hypotheses. Differences are then compared and analyzed for accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When both sides are headstrong towards the other, TAB allows each to see the other side's perspective.
  </li>
  <li>
    Policymakers are able to see both perspectives and respond with questions to the analysts or make their own conclusion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Forcing analysts of mindset A to work on Team B and vice versa can hone analytic skills to be unbiased and make the analyst aware of their own mindset.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Analysis Phase:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify the two (or more) competing hypotheses or points of view.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form teams or designate individuals to develop the best case that can be made for each hypothesis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Review all pertinent information that supports their respective positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify missing information that would buttress their hypotheses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Structure each argument with an explicit presentation of key assumptions, key pieces of evidence, and careful articulation of the logic behind the argument.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Debate Phase:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Set aside time for an oral presentation of the alternative team findings; this can an informal brainstorming session or a more formal “debate".
      </li>
      <li>
        Have an independent “jury of peers” listen to the oral presentation and be prepared to question the teams regarding their assumptions, evidence, or logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow each team to present their case, challenge the other team’s arguments, and rebut the opponent’s critique of its case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the jury consider the strength of each presentation and recommend possible next steps for further research and collection efforts.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_contrarian_techniques_high_impact_low_probability">High-Impact/Low-Probability Analysis</h4>

<p>
  High-impact/low-probability events are also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan events</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The event should not be brushed off due to its low probability: instead, the impact should be the main concern. After all, if the event happens and there was no contingency plan, there will be an unorganized scramble to react. The seemingly low probability may increase after a brief examination, as analysts may uncover important information in the process.
</p>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Define the high-impact outcome clearly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Devise one or more plausible explanations for or “pathways” to the low probability outcome. This should be as precise as possible, as it can help identify possible indicators for later monitoring.
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert possible triggers or changes in momentum if appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Brainstorm with analysts having a broad set of experiences to aid the development of plausible but unpredictable triggers of sudden change.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify for each pathway a set of indicators or “observables” that would help you anticipate that events were beginning to play out this way.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify factors that would deflect a bad outcome or encourage a positive outcome.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_contrarian_techniques_what_if">"What If?" Analysis</h4>

<p>
  Imagine if a low-probability event has occurred. What could have caused it?
</p>

<p>
  This type of analysis allows analysts to get imaginative about causes while not considering the probability, especially if there is little information available. Brainstorming these causes may also point to additional sources of information not otherwise considered.
</p>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Assume the event has happened.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select some triggering events that permitted the scenario to unfold to help make the “what if” more plausible; for example, analysts might postulate the death of a leader, a natural disaster, or some economic event that would start a chain of other events.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a chain of argumentation based as much on logic as evidence to explain how this outcome could have come about.
  </li>
  <li>
    “Think backwards” from the event in concrete ways–that is, specifying what must actually occur at each stage of the scenario is often very useful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify one or more plausible pathways or scenarios to the unlikely event; very often more than one will appear possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate a list of indicators or “observables” for each scenario that would help to detect the beginnings of the event.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the scope of the positive and negative consequences of each scenario and their relative impacts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitor the indicators developed on a periodic basis.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_imaginative_thinking_techniques">Imaginative Thinking Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_imaginative_thinking_techniques_brainstorming"></h4>

<p>
  Brainstorming is simple: come up with new ideas related to the problem at hand. It can be applied to virtually any problem and used in conjunction with every technique discussed thus far. It can develop creativity and allow outside-the-box thinking.
</p>

<p>
  While an unstructured process (can it really be called a process?) may produce some results, following a set of instructions and brainstorming at each step works best. While brainstorming, there are no wrong or weird answers. Everyone is equal. Everything, including the source of the idea (why did you come up with that?) should be considered. Involving someone unfamiliar with the topic helps, as it brings in a new perspective.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Divergent Thinking Phase:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Distribute “Post-It” notes and pens or markers to all participants. Typically, 10-12 people works best.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pose the problem in terms of a “focal question.” Display it in one sentence on a large easel or whiteboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask the group to write down responses to the question, using key words that will fit on the small “Post-It” note.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stick all the notes on a wall for all to see—treat all ideas the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a pause follows the initial flow of ideas, the group is reaching the end of their conventional thinking and the new divergent ideas are then likely to emerge.
      </li>
      <li>
        End the “collection stage” of the brainstorming after two or three pauses.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Convergent Thinking Phase:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask the participants as a group to rearrange the notes on the wall according to their commonalities or similar concepts. No talking is permitted. Some notes may be moved several times as notes begin to cluster. Copying some notes is permitted to allow ideas to be included in more than one group.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a word or phrase that characterizes each grouping or cluster once all the notes have been arranged.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify any notes that do not easily fit with others and consider them either useless noise or the beginning of an idea that deserves further attention.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assess what the group has accomplished in terms of new ideas or concepts identified or new areas that need more work or further brainstorming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instruct each participant to select one or two areas that deserve the most attention. Tabulate the votes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the brainstorming group’s priorities based on the voting and decide on the next steps for analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_imaginative_thinking_techniques_outside_in">Outside-In Thinking</h4>

<blockquote>
  [Outside-in thinking is] used to identify the full range of basic forces, factors, and trends that would indirectly shape an issue.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  encourages analysts to get away from their immediate analytic tasks (the so-called “inbox”) and think about their issues in a wider conceptual and contextual framework. By recasting the problem in much broader and fundamental terms, analysts are more likely to uncover additional factors, an important dynamic, or a relevant alternative hypothesis.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    List all the key forces (social, technological, economic, environmental, and political) that could have an impact on the topic, but over which one can exert little influence (e.g., globalization, social stress, the Internet, or the global economy).
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus next on key factors over which an actor or policymaker can exert some influence. In the business world this might be the market size, customers, the competition, suppliers or partners; in the government domain it might include the policy actions or the behavior of allies or adversaries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assess how each of these forces could affect the analytic problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine whether these forces actually do have an impact on the particular issue based on the available evidence.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_imaginative_thinking_techniques_red_team">Red Team Analysis</h4>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">Red teams</a> have origins in military applications, where analysts would play the role of the enemy (red team) and brainstorm methods to harm the friendlies (blue team). Red teams are important to use when trying to look at a situation from another culture's perspective (see the end of <a href="#tradecraft_primer_introduction">Introduction</a> for examples). Foreign cultures do not follow the same expectations or behaviors as Americans, and this should anticipated well in advance. Knowledge of foreign cultures or access to individuals of that culture is key, as they have first-hand experience and can advise based on their perspective.
</p>

<p>
  Personality should also be considered. It is known that some leaders are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_officials_purged_and_executed_by_Kim_Jong-un">ruthless in ruling</a> and others have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/tag/philippines-war-drugs">values not accepted</a> by Americans.
</p>

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Put themselves in the adversary’s circumstances and react to foreign stimuli as the target would.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a set of “first-person” questions that the adversary would ask, such as: “How would I perceive incoming information; what would be my personal concerns; or to whom would I look for an opinion?”
  </li>
  <li>
    Draft a set of policy papers in which the leader or group makes specific decisions, proposes recommendations, or lays out courses of actions. The more these papers reflect the cultural and personal norms of the target, the more they can offer a different perspective on the analytic problem.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tradecraft_primer_imaginative_thinking_techniques_alternative_futures">Alternative Futures Analysis</h4>

<p>
  Some situations can be complex, have too much uncertainty, or too little information to choose only one hypothesis/outcome. The Alternative Futures analysis instead comes up with multiple outcomes that can occur. This takes significant resources (experts, policymakers, time) and " is best reserved for situations that could potentially pose grave threats or otherwise have significant consequences".
</p>

<img src="media/alternative_futures.png" alt="alternative_futures" width="200" class="center">

<p>
  Method:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Develop the “focal issue” by systematically interviewing experts and officials who are examining the general topic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Convene a group of experts (both internal and external) to brainstorm about the forces and factors that could affect the focal issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select by consensus the two most critical and uncertain forces and convert these into axes or continua with the most relevant endpoints assigned.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish the most relevant endpoints for each factor; e.g., if economic growth were the most critical, uncertain force, the endpoints could be “fast” and “slow” or “transformative” and “stabilizing” depending on the type of issue addressed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form a futures matrix by crossing the two chosen axes. The four resulting quadrants provide the basis for characterizing alternative future worlds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate colorful stories that describe these futures and how they could plausibly come about. Signposts or indicators can then be developed.
  </li>
</ul>

<img src="media/techniques_timeline.png" alt="techniques_timeline" width="200" class="center">

<h3 id="tradecraft_primer_summary">Summary</h3>

<p>
  While the techniques presented are all slightly different, the general idea of each is almost identical. Below is a brief summary:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Analyze all possible outcomes with a focus on those with high-impact and/or high-probability, preferably in this order: HIHP, HILP, LIHP, LILP. Never underestimate the probability of an occurrence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recognize personal biases/mindsets and attempt to at least mitigate them, if not altogether eliminate. Consult with others who are not subject to the same biases/mindsets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at situations from all possible vantage points for a comprehensive analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Challenge any and every assumption, mindset, and information source.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continually refine the analysis as new information is processed or mindsets changed.
  </li>
</ul>
