<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  In <a href="../experiences/europe.html">August-September 2023 I traveled to France</a> without being able to speak any French. In fact, I'm monolingual, also known as American.
</p>

<p>
  I asked myself a handful of times how awesome it would have been to have studied it regularly for a few months beforehand, concluding that it would have actually been pretty awesome. I could have made decent conversations with strangers, not felt awkward ordering at restaurants, and been able to read significantly faster off of menus, signs, etc.
</p>

<p>
  But the answer always ended with "what's the point? It's effectively useless for me." After all, I had already tried learning Arabic and Russian, the former being very difficult for native English speakers (category IV, or 2200 class hours) and the latter being difficult (category III, or 1100 class hours) and failed miserably (although I can still read their alphabets, so it wasn't completely in vain). I doubt I'll travel to France more than once per year or every other year, I know a single French speaker in real life, and my city's second language is definitely not French.
</p>

<p>
  The Arabic and Russian efforts were well before I started this website, before I wanted to learn deeply about what motivates and disciplines me for future efforts.
</p>

<p>
  Thus the thesis statement of this new effort: I believe that learning the French language will allow me to learn what I am motivated and disciplined by.

<p>
  There are a few things I think I will respond well to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Shame: Explaining (or even announcing) that I started and quit learning French is embarrassing
  </li>
  <li>
    Money: Betting that I am at level Ax or Bx by X date or risk losing $Y is very costly (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are a few things I think I won't respond well to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Status: While a cool perk, people knowing I speak French is unimportant to me. I've had other efforts in the past that were motivated by others' thoughts and eventually failed.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Benefits of learning French include:

<ul>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now these losses (read: punishments) should be determined with objective resolutions: I must pass a French A2 test by 30 June 2024, or else I:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Shame: Post on Facebook that I tried and failed to learn French
  </li>
  <li>
    Money: Burn $2,000 (yes, literally)
  </li>
</ul>
